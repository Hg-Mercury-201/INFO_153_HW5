Your computer's graphics card or GPU is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance (followed by the CPU). To help you choose the right graphics card for your rig, we thoroughly review and stress test all the major cards, ranking each platform in our GPU hierarchy. Below, we publish our list of specific make and model recommendations.

Quick Shopping Tips
When buying a graphics card, consider the following:

Resolution: The more pixels you're pushing, the more performance you need. You don't need top-of-the-line to game at 1080p.
PSU: Make sure that your power supply has enough juice and the right 6 or 8-pin connector. For example, AMD recommends a 750-watt PSU for the Radeon VII.
Video Memory: We recommend at least a 4GB card for 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 (QHD resolution) play at the highest quality settings and at least 8GB of memory for 3840 x 2160 (4K resolution).
FreeSync or G-Sync? Either variable refresh rate technology will synchronize your GPU's frame rate with your screen's refresh rate. If your monitor supports AMD's FreeSync anti-tearing tech, you need a Radeon card. G-Sync-capable displays require Nvidia GeForce cards to do their magic, although you can now run G-Sync on some FreeSync monitors.
Best Graphics Cards for Gaming
Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti
Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti

1. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
Best Overall (When Price is No Object)

Rating: 4.5 / 5 (Editor's Choice)

GPU: Turing (TU102) | Core Clock: 1,350 MHz | Video RAM: 11GB GDDR5X | TDP: 260 watts

Pros: Smooth performance at 4K, High Settings • Packed with future-looking tech • Great thermal solution supports boost clocks

Cons: Price is out of reach for most users

Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the first card we’ve tested able to deliver smooth frame rates at 4K with detail settings maxed out, something the previous-generation GeForce GTX 1080 Ti couldn’t quite manage. The GTX 2080 Ti’s halo features aren’t used in many games yet, but as those come online, the Turing architecture is expected to shine even brighter. That said, Nvidia's recent driver release unlocks ray tracing support on non-RTX cards. So if you have a capable previous-generation Pascal (10-series) card, you can at least try out those snazzy lighting and shadow effects. 

Nvidia also did a good job improving the cooler on its Founders Edition version of the 2080 Ti, leading to high sustained clock speeds. That said, the $1,200 (£1,100/$1,900 AU)-plus price means this card is out of reach for the vast majority of gamers. Only those who are truly after a no-compromise 4K gaming experience should consider this card. Both the GTX 1080 Ti, and the one-step-down RTX 2080 are capable of smooth UHD gaming, providing you’re willing to switch off a few settings.

Note that we've also tested Nvidia's RTX Titan. It's a more powerful card based around the same silicon as the RTX 2080 Ti, with more memory. But it's not significantly faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, not aimed specifically at gamers, and it's priced at $2,500 (£2,400). The Titan runs games very well, but we don't recommend buying it strictly for gaming purposes.

2. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070
Best for VR Gaming

Rating: 3.5 / 5

GPU: Turing (TU106) | Core Clock: 1,410 MHz | Video RAM:  8GB GDDR6 | TDP: 185 watts

Pros: Faster than GTX 1080 • Quiet under load • Good cooling

Cons: Expensive

Enthusiasts with VR headsets need to achieve a certain level of performance to avoid jarring artifacts. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 2070 is fast enough to keep up with the 90 Hz refresh rates of most modern head-mounted displays (HMDs). Moreover, it includes a VirtualLink port for connecting next-generation headsets with a single cable. That’s not really a useful feature today, but it will likely come in handy the next time you consider upgrading your VR headset.

While stock remained high for the previous-generation GeForce GTX 1080, keeping prices low, it was easy to recommend that card over newer RTX options. But now that’s no longer the case, and pricing for the RTX 2070 has occasionally slipped below the starting MSRP of $499 (£450, $800 AUD).

With more than enough pixel punch to handle smooth VR and prices generally below that of the older GTX 1080, the GeForce RTX 2070 is our new pick for VR. Those who want more performance future-proofing may also consider the GeForce RTX 2080, but with pricing for that card starting around $700 (£642, $1,120 AUD), the 2070 is easily a better value for a couple hundred dollars less.

3. Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB)
Best for 2K Gaming

Rating:4.5 / 5 (Editor's Choice)

GPU:  Turing (TU116) | Core Clock: 1,500 MHz | Video RAM: 6GB GDDR6 | TDP: 120 watts

Pros: Great performance at 1920 x 1080 • Acceptable frame rates at 2560 x 1440 • Retains Turing's video encode/decode acceleration features • 120W board power compares favorably to AMD competition

Cons: No RT/Tensor cores mean you won't be able to try ray tracing or DLSS

Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is the card to beat for high-refresh gaming at 1920 x 1080 and solid performance at 2560 x 1440 (1440p), delivering frame rates similar to the previous-generation GeForce GTX 1070.

Stepping up to the GeForce RTX 2060 will get you higher frame rates at 1440p, while also bringing the company’s Tensor/RT cores to the table. But with a tiny number of current games supporting those features, the 2060 doesn’t look as good in our performance-per-dollar charts, making the 1660 Ti a better value for most 1080p-plus gamers.

That said, if you have a high-refresh 2K screen and / or are particularly excited about what DLSS and ray tracing will bring to more games in the coming months and years, the RTX 2060 is worth paying the extra $70 (£50) or so for.

4. AMD Radeon RX 580 (8GB)
Best for 1080p Gaming

Rating: 4/5

GPU: Polaris 10 (GCN 4.0) | Core Clock: 1,411 MHz | Video RAM: 4GB/8GB GDDR5 | TDP: 185 watts 

Pros: Smooth frame rates at 1920 x 1080 • Low power consumption with multiple monitors • Available in both 4GB and 8GB capacities

Cons: Higher power consumption than Radeon RX 480

AMD’s Radeon RX 580 is based on the same Polaris 10 GPU as the Radeon RX 480 that preceded it. AMD simply dialed in higher clock rates to improve performance. While we’re always appreciative of higher frame rates, this also had the side-effect of increasing power consumption. Still, Radeon RX 580 generally outperforms the similarly-priced GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, particularly in DirectX 12 games, earning it a spot on our list.

The newer AMD Radeon RX 590 that debuted in late 2018 is yet another refresh of the same Polaris GPU, which bumps up performance compared to the competing Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. But better performance comes at the cost of higher power consumption, necessitating larger coolers that sometimes chew up three expansion slots on your motherboard. Factor in a $279 (£240, $480 AU) MSRP and AMD’s newer card becomes tough to recommend when so many similar-performing RX 580s are still available for significantly less money.

5. AMD Radeon RX 570 (4GB)
Best Budget GPU

Rating: 3.5 / 5

GPU: Ellesmere | Core Clock: 1,206 MHz | Video RAM: 4GB GDDR5 | TDP: 150 watts 

Pros: Slightly faster than Radeon RX 470, excellent 1080p performance • AMD maintains competitive pricing • Ample memory (4GB GDDR5) proves valuable in comparisons to GeForce GTX 1060 3GB

Cons: Slightly faster than Radeon RX 470, excellent 1080p performance • AMD maintains competitive pricing • Ample memory (4GB GDDR5) proves valuable in comparisons to GeForce GTX 1060 3GB

There’s been lots of turmoil in the budget gaming card space over the last couple years, despite a general lack of substantively new hardware. For a long time, the crypto-ming craze kept AMD’s RX 570 card priced high (and often made it hard to find in stock), keeping it out of our budget considerations. But now that’s over and an abundance of AMD cards has pushed the price of the 2017-era RX 570 (itself a re-work of 2016’s RX 470) down to around $130 (£127) and up for 4GB models. That makes AMD’s card easy to recommend over our previous recommendation, the 3GB GTX 1050, which currently sells for about $30 (£20) more.

The Radeon RX 570 appeals specifically to folks gunning for high-detail gaming at 1920x1080 (1080p), who don’t have the budget to step up to an RX 580. That said, with 8GB RX 580s often dipping below the $200 (£154) mark these days, AMD’s stepped-up card is arguably a better buy. That’s particularly true for those looking for long-term gaming performance at 1080p or interested in experimenting with high-resolution texture packs. The additional 4GB of memory will likely become increasingly important in future memory-hungry titles, making the RX 580 a card with more gaming performance longevity.

Please don't give up on the GPU Performance Hierarchy Table. I see it's now been renamed "Legacy GPU Hierarchy", so I hope that doesn't mean you intend to stop updating it.

For many years this table has been the single best resource for quickly comparing graphics cards. Detailed reviews are great for comparing cards within a category, but for quickly dismissing a card or prompting further research, there is nothing else on the web which compares to it. It would be a real shame for it to fall into neglect.

Dang, what happened to the around $100 and under market? Does it all suck right now? Or have GPU's tied into the CPU advanced that much?

I think they're going to keep it...although I do wish they'd kept a 3rd column for Intel's integrated graphics (as well as the Vega-equipped Ryzen/Athlon chips).
SR TEE
If you want to do 4K gaming I'd hold off on the GTX 2080TI until AMD releases their RX 680 to see what it can do or save yourself some money and get the GTX 1080TI for $450 to $550 cheaper. $1200 is a total ouch for most people I personally know, but if you want the best at the moment and newest Ray Tracing tech(which there's no 100% guaranty it will catch on) and have the money to burn be my guest.

Just my opinion and please feel free to disagree.

Happy gaming all.
IMHASSANPIRACHA
ZOTAC 1070ti AMP Xtreme should make this list. It is going for around USD $420. Can be overclocked above 2000 MHZ easily. it is one of the most silent cards I have seen with lowest temps at full stress. IMO

The under $100 market has always sucked. If you're looking in that price range, look at buying a generation older cards used. A GTX 960 4GB performs in the neighborhood of a 1050/1050 Ti and can be had for around a 100 if you hunt around craigslist or ebay.

1) The GTX 1050 3GB didn't earn a spot on this list.
The RX 580 4GB consistenly beats the GTX1050 by a landslide (~20-50% FPS), costs 10$ less AND it comes with the newest Assassins Creed: Odyssey for free (50-60$ value and two other games).
(PowerColor RED DRAGON Radeon RX 570 is 159.99$ Newegg link below)

2) The RX 580 8GB is available for 50$ less than displayed here on the same retailer AND it comes with the newest Assassins Creed: Odyssey for free (and two other games).
(PowerColor RED DEVIL Radeon RX 580 is 229.99$ Newegg link below)

P.S. No I don't work for PowerColor, I picked the cheapest card with the free game bundles.

3) Recommending any Nvidia card for the midrange is just plain wrong simply because of G-sync. The best improvement for any gaming machine is adding FreeSync or G-sync to eliminate tearing or avoiding V-sync, which most probably will drop your framerate to 30fps or even 15fps in newer games on those weaker cards.
24in-1080p-144Hz-FreeSync monitors are available for less than 200$.
24in-1080p-144Hz-G-sync monitors start around 350$.
That's a 150$ difference that has to be considered.

4) Even the not so midrange GTX 1070 isn't a clear winner, as the Vega 56 is in the same price range and has about the same performance, offers a free game bundle (60$+ value) and still has the FreeSync (150$) advantage. No one in their right mind will drop ~400$ on a graphics card and then play without FreeSync/G-sync.
My take on this tier:
Buy AMD Vega 56 if:
- you want to get "Assassins Creed: Odyssey" anyways.
- you already own a FreeSync monitor or will upgrade your monitor in the foreseeable future.
- you don't have a monitor yet.
- you do have a FreeSync TV or plan to buy one and enjoy playing controller/couch-games like Assassins Creed, retro emulators, Street Fighter, GTA, Batman, Dirt etc.
Buy Nvidia GTX 1070 if:
- you are upgrading your PC and your Power supply has less than 650W
- you already own a G-sync monitor

Sorry typo in my comment above
"The RX 580 4GB consistenly beats the GTX1050" ... should be "The RX 570 4GB"
DANG10010
Here's my version
$100 - $120 budget card- the RX 560 https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&IsNodeId=1&N=100007709%20601296397
These cards are almost neck and neck with the 1050 in most games and is currently $70 less than the 1050.

$150 - $175 FHD- the RX 570 https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007709%20601296379%20601296377&IsNodeId=1
The RX 570 has come back down to Earth in the past month or so and has plenty of power to game at the 1080 resolutions plus you get AMD freesync, it's also $100 cheaper than the rx 580, look around for an open box or sale and you just might pick up a 580 for $10 - $20 more.

$400 QHD- the 1070ti https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007709%20601305993&IsNodeId=1
Why not spend another $10 to $20 and get the ti version instead, for most games it's neck and neck with the 1080 and consumes less power. Use a rebate and it's under $400. This is also a very good card for pushing past that 120 fps limit if high frames is your thing.

$750 Best for VR- the 2080 https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007709%20601321570&IsNodeId=1
Spend a few more dollars and get a new generation card, wait for Xmas and save $?

Obviously the fastest card out there is a 2080ti, so go out and get one now after you sell your car and start taking the bus.

I think we all loved the gpu hierarchy table. Mostly as an easy way to compare our older gpu's. I am a fan of the "best for" rankings they use in these articles. Just to help put it in perspective for amateur builders.

I think there should be some AMD options at the top just because of the fact that Freesync costs about $200 less than G-Sync for those who want a nice system but are on a tighter budget.

It did as the 1030 was well into the $90's but now I see some getting down to $69. Not a great price for the bottom of the barrel 1030's. Give it about a month or two for the prices to return back to pre-cryptocurrency levels. The 1030 DDR4 should be in the $50's so they are also a bit high priced still. Most of the AMD 550 and 560's are also returning to normal pricing but they need a bit longer as well and possible a discount or game bundle.
NONE12345
Just yesterday toms posted an article about a $160 4gb 580. Anyone who is buying a $140 1050 is an idiot vs spending $20 more for a 580. +70-80% performance for +15% price is an absolute no brainer. (unless you absolutely need a card without a power connector, as the 1050 is the fastest card that does not need a power connector).

Its like the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing at toms.
GARREK99
Shouldn't the 2070 replace the 1080 for best VR pick?
It's cheaper and faster and adds ray tracing.

 The Best Graphics Cards of 2017
How to Buy the Best GPU for Gaming
If you're a PC gamer, or a content creator who lives and dies by the speed of your graphics-accelerated software, your video card is the engine that powers what you can do—or how lustily you can brag. And until just a few months ago, that bragging was really expensive.

Over the last two years, at times buying a video card felt like dishing out for a rare flower bulb, not a PC component, amid some 21st-century tulip frenzy. The cryptomining crazes of 2017 and 2018 drove wild demand for graphics horsepower—the kind of computing muscle best suited to amateur and professional digital currency mining—and thus for certain video cards. Prices for even modest mainstream cards flew sky-high. For a time, the market went downright bonkers. Some cards traded for double or more than their list prices, if you could find them in stock at all.

Here in '19, that hubbub has died down—at least for the moment. Our guide will help you sort through the best video-card options for your desktop PC, what you need to know to upgrade a system, and how to evaluate whether a particular card is a good buy. We'll also touch on some upcoming trends—they could affect which card you choose.

Even with cryptomania on the wane for now, you do need to choose with care. After all, consumer video cards range from under $50 to well over $1,000. It's easy to overpay or underbuy. (We won't let you do that, though.)

Who's Who in GPUs
First off, what does a graphics card do? And do you really need one?

If you're looking at any given pre-built desktop PC on the market, unless it's a gaming-oriented machine, PC makers will de-emphasize the graphics card in favor of promoting CPU, RAM, or storage options. Indeed, sometimes that's for good reason; a low-cost PC may not have a graphics card at all, relying instead on the graphics-acceleration silicon built into its CPU (an "integrated graphics processor," commonly called an "IGP"). There's nothing inherently wrong with relying on an IGP—most business laptops, inexpensive consumer laptops, and budget-minded desktops have them—but if you're a gamer or a creator, the right graphics card is crucial.

Image: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition-8.jpg

A modern graphics solution, whether it's a discrete video card or an IGP, handles the display of 2D and 3D content, drawing the desktop, and decoding and encoding video content in programs and games. All of the discrete video cards on the consumer market are built around large graphics processing chips designed by one of two companies: AMD or Nvidia. These processors are referred to as "GPUs," for "graphics processing units," a term that is also applied, confusingly, to the graphics card itself. (Nothing about graphics cards...ahem, GPUs...is simple!)

MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Gaming X Trio 5

The two companies work up what are known as "reference designs" for their video cards, a standardized version of a card built around a given GPU. Sometimes these reference-design cards are sold directly by Nvidia (or, less often, by AMD) themselves to consumers. More often, though, they are duplicated by third-party card makers (companies referred to in industry lingo as AMD or Nvidia "board partners"), such as Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte, Sapphire, XFX, and Zotac.

Depending on the graphics chip in question, these board partners may sell their own self-branded versions of the reference card (adhering to the design and specifications set by AMD or Nvidia), or they will fashion their own custom products, with different cooler designs, slight overclocking done from the factory, or features such as LED mood illumination. Some board partners will do both—that is, sell reference versions of a given GPU, as well as its own, more radical designs.

Who Needs a Discrete GPU?
We mentioned integrated graphics (IGPs) above. IGPs are capable of meeting the needs of most general users today, with three broad exceptions...

Professional Workstation Users. These folks, who work with CAD software or in video and photo editing, will still benefit greatly from a discrete GPU. Some of their key applications can transcode video from one format to another or perform other specialized operations using resources from the GPU instead of (or in addition to) those of the CPU. Whether this is faster will depend on the application in question, which specific GPU and CPU you own, and other factors.

Productivity-Minded Users With Multiple Displays. People who need a large number of displays can also benefit from a discrete GPU. Desktop operating systems can drive displays connected to the IGP and discrete GPUs simultaneously. If you've ever wanted five or six displays hooked up to a single system, you can combine an IGP and a discrete GPU to get there.

That said, you don't necessarily need a high-end graphics card to do that. If you're simply displaying business applications, multiple browser windows, or lots of static windows across multiple displays (i.e., not demanding PC games), all you need is a card that supports the display specifications, resolutions, monitor interfaces, and number of panels you need. If you're showing four web browsers across four display panels, a GeForce RTX 2080 card, say, won't confer any greater benefit than a GeForce GTX 1660 card with the same supported outputs.

Gamers. And of course, there's the gaming market, to whom the GPU is arguably the most important component. RAM and CPU choices both matter, but if you have to pick between a top-end system circa 2016 with a 2019 GPU or a top-end system today using the highest-end GPU you could buy in 2016, you'd want the former.

Graphics cards fall into two distinct classes: consumer cards meant for gaming and light content creation work, and dedicated cards meant for professional workstations and geared toward scientific computing, calculations, and artificial intelligence work. This guide, and our reviews, will focus on the former, but we'll touch on workstation cards a little bit, later on. The key sub-brands you need to know across these two fields are Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon RX (on the consumer side of things), and Nvidia's Titan and Quadro, as well as AMD's Radeon Pro and Radeon Instinct (in the pro workstation field). As recently as 2017, Nvidia had the very high end of the consumer graphics-card market more or less to itself, and it still dominates there.

Nvidia Titan RTX graphics card

We'll focus here on the consumer cards. Nvidia's consumer card line in 2019 is broken into two distinct classes, both united under the long-running GeForce brand: GeForce GTX, and GeForce RTX. AMD's consumer cards, meanwhile, comprise the Radeon RX and Radeon RX Vega families, as well as the new Radeon VII.

Before we get into the individual lines in detail, though, let's outline a very important consideration for any video-card purchase.

Target Resolution: Your First Consideration
Resolution is the horizontal-by-vertical pixel count at which your video card will drive your monitor. This has a huge bearing on which card to buy, and how much you need to spend, when looking at a video card from a gaming perspective.

If you are a PC gamer, a big part of what you'll want to consider is the resolution(s) at which a given video card is best suited for gaming. Nowadays, even low-end cards will display everyday programs at lofty resolutions like 3,840 by 2,160 pixels (a.k.a., 4K). But for strenuous PC games, those cards will not have nearly the power to drive smooth frame rates at high resolutions like those. In games, the video card is what calculates positions, geometry, and lighting, and renders the onscreen image in real time. For that, the higher the in-game detail level and monitor resolution you're running, the more graphics-card muscle is required.

The three most common resolutions at which today's gamers play are 1080p (1,920 by 1,080 pixels), 1440p (2,560 by 1,440 pixels), and 2160p or 4K (3,840 by 2,160 pixels). Generally speaking, you'll want to choose a card suited for your monitor's native resolution. (The "native" resolution is the highest supported by the panel, and the one at which the display looks the best.) You'll also see ultra-wide-screen monitors with in-between resolutions (3,840 by 1,440 pixels is a common one); you can gauge these versus 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p by calculating the raw number of pixels for each (multiply the vertical number by the horizontal one) and seeing where that screen resolution fits in relative to the common ones. (See our targeted roundup of the best graphics cards for 1080p play.)

Now, of course, you can always dial down the detail levels for a game to make it run acceptably at a higher-than-recommended resolution, or dial back the resolution itself. But to an extent, that defeats the purpose of a graphics card purchase. The highest-end cards are meant for 4K play or for playing at very high refresh rates at 1080p or 1440p; you don't have to spend $1,000 or even $500 to play more than acceptably at 1080p. A secondary consideration nowadays, though, is running games at ultra-high frame rates to take advantage of the extra-fast refresh abilities of some new monitors; more on that later. Let's look at the graphics card makers' lines first, and see which ones are suited for what gaming resolutions.

Meet the Radeon and GeForce Families
The GPU lines of the two big graphics-chip makers are constantly evolving, with low-end models suited to low-resolution gameplay ranging up to elite-priced models for gaming at 4K and/or very high refresh rates. Let's look at Nvidia's first.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 NVLink

Nvidia's Lineup, 2019
The company's current line is split between cards using last-generation (a.k.a. "10-series") GPUs dubbed the "Pascal" line, and newer GTX 1600- and RTX 2000-series lines, based on GPUs using an architecture called "Turing." Its Titan cards are outliers; more on them in a bit.

Here's a quick rundown of the currently relevant card classes in the Pascal and Turing families, their rough pricing, and their usage cases...

Nvidia Card Summary 2019

If you are a keen observer of the market, you may notice that many of the familiar GeForce GTX Pascal cards are not listed above. They are being allowed to sell through and are largely going off the market in 2019 in favor of their GeForce RTX successors. We expect this to happen soon for the GeForce GTX 1060 due to the release of the GeForce GTX 1660 and 1660 Ti, and eventually, the lesser Pascal cards. We'd class the GT 1030 to GTX 1050 as low-end cards, coming under $100 or a little above. The GTX 1650/1050 Ti to GTX 1660 Ti make up Nvidia's comprehensive midrange, spanning from about $150 to $350, with a few of these cards ranging close to $500. (We expect the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti to be replaced by a possible GeForce GTX 1650 Ti later in the year, if rumors are to be taken at face value.)

With apologies to nu-soul and nu-metal, the end-of-lifing GTX 1080-class cards, as well as the new RTX 2060 and RTX 2070, constitute what we'd call the "nu-high end," as they take the place of the old top-end GeForces in the $350 to $700 range. The RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti cards, finally, we'd call a new "elite class."

As for the Titan cards, these are essentially stripped-down workstation cards that bridge the pro graphics and high-end/4K gaming worlds. For most gamers, the Titans won't be of interest due to their pricing. But know that the Titan Xp (older, around $1,200) and newer Titan RTX ($2,500) and Titan V ($2,999) cards are options for Powerball-winning gamers, machine-learning pioneers, AI developers, or folks involved in pro/academic GPU-bound calculation work.

AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 (Angle View)

AMD's Lineup, 2019
As for AMD's card classes, here in early '19 the company is stronger competing with Nvidia's low-end and mainstream cards than its high-end ones, and it puts up no resistance against the elite class...

AMD Radeon Summary

The Radeon RX 550 and 560 comprise the low end, while the RX 570 to 590 are the midrange and ideal for 1080p gaming. The RX 580 and RX Vega 56 and Vega 64 cards, the latter good for 1080p and 1440p play, were hit particularly hard by the crypto-craze but have come back down to earth. The Radeon VII is AMD's sole player in the elite bracket; it trades blows with the GeForce RTX 2080 at 4K but generally performed less well at lower resolutions in games.

Graphics Card Basics: Understanding the Core Specs
Now, the charts above should give you a good idea of which card families you should be looking at, based on your monitor and your target resolution. A few key numbers are worth keeping in mind when comparing cards, though: the graphics processor's clock speed, the onboard VRAM (that is, how much video memory it has), and—of course!—the pricing. And then there's adaptive sync.

Clock Speed
When comparing GPUs from the same family, a higher base clock speed (that is, the speed at which the graphics core works) and more cores signify a faster GPU. Again, though: That's only a valid comparison between cards in the same product family. For example, the base clock on the venerable GeForce GTX 1080 is 1,733MHz, while the base clock is 1,759MHz on a (factory overclocked) Republic of Gamers Strix version of the GTX 1080 from Asus in its out-of-the-box Gaming Mode.

Note that this base clock measure is distinct from the graphics chip's boost clock. The boost clock is the speed to which the graphics chip can accelerate temporarily when under load, as thermal conditions allow. This can also vary from card to card in the same family. It depends on the robustness of the cooling hardware on the card and the aggressiveness of the manufacturer in its factory settings. The top-end partner cards with giant multifan coolers will tend to have the highest boost clocks for a given GPU.

Onboard Memory
The amount of onboard video memory (sometimes referred to by the rusty term "frame buffer") is usually matched to the requirements of the games or programs that the card is designed to run. In a certain sense, from a PC-gaming perspective, you can count on a video card to have enough memory to handle current demanding games at the resolutions and detail levels that the card is suited for. In other words, a card maker generally won't overprovision a card with more memory than it can realistically use; that would inflate the pricing and make the card less competitive. But there are some wrinkles to this.

A card designed for gameplay at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1080p) these days will generally be outfitted with 4GB or 6GB of RAM, while cards geared more toward play at 2,560 by 1,440 pixels (1440p) or 3,840 by 2,160 (2160p, or 4K) tend to deploy 8GB or more. Usually, for cards based on a given GPU, all of the cards have a standard amount of memory. The wrinkles: In some isolated but important cases, card makers offer versions of a card with the same GPU but different amounts of VRAM. The key ones to know nowadays: cards based on the GeForce GTX 1060 (some lesser versions offer 3GB, versus the full-fat 6GB), and the Radeon RX 570 and RX 580 (4GB versus 8GB). Both are GPUs you'll find in popular midrange cards a bit above or below $200, so mind the memory amount on these. The cheaper versions will have less.

XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition

Now, if you're looking to spend $150 or more on a video card, with the idea of all-out 1080p gameplay, a card with at least 4GB of memory really shouldn't be negotiable. Both AMD and Nvidia now outfit their $200-plus GPUs with more RAM than this. (AMD has stepped up to 8GB on its RX Vega cards, with 16GB on its Radeon VII, while Nvidia is using 6GB or 8GB on most, with 11GB on its elite GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.) Either way, sub-4GB cards should only be used for secondary systems, gaming at low resolutions, or simple or older games that don't need much in the way of hardware resources.

Memory bandwidth is another spec you will see. It refers to how quickly data can move into and out of the GPU. More is generally better, but again, AMD and Nvidia have different architectures and sometimes different memory bandwidth requirements, so numbers are not directly comparable.

Pricing: How Much Should You Spend?
Generations of cards come and go, but the price bands were constant for years—at least, when the market was not distorted by cryptocurrency miners. Now that the rush has abated, AMD and Nvidia both are targeting light 1080p gaming in the $100-to-$180 price range, higher-end 1080p and entry-level 1440p in cards between $200 to $300, and light to high-detail 1440p gaming between $300 and $400.

If you want a card that can handle 4K handily, you'll need to spend more than $400. A GPU that can push 4K gaming at high detail levels will cost $500 to $1,200. Cards in the $150-to-$350 market generally offer performance improvements in line with their additional cost. If a card is a certain amount costlier than another, the increase in performance is usually proportional to the increase in price. In the high-end and elite-level card stacks, though, this rule falls away; spending more money yields diminishing returns.

Once a Religious Issue: FreeSync Vs. G-Sync
Should you buy a card based whether it supports one of these two venerable specs for smoothing gameplay? It depends on the monitor you have.

FreeSync (AMD's solution) and G-Sync (Nvidia's) are two sides to the same coin, a technology called adaptive sync. With adaptive sync, the monitor displays at a variable refresh rate led by the video card; the screen draws at a rate that scales up and down according to the card's output capabilities at any given time in a game. Without it, wobbles in the frame rate can lead to artifacts, staggering/stuttering action, or screen tearing, in which mismatched screen halves display momentarily. Under adaptive sync, the monitor draws a full frame only when the video card can deliver a whole frame.

The monitor you own may support FreeSync or G-Sync, or neither one. FreeSync is much more common, as it doesn't add to a monitor's manufacturing cost; G-Sync requires dedicated hardware inside the display. You may wish to opt for one GPU maker's wares or the other's based on this, but know that the tides are changing on this front. At CES 2019, Nvidia announced a driver tweak that will allow FreeSync-compatible monitors to use adaptive sync with late-model Nvidia GeForce cards, and a small subset of FreeSync monitors have been certified by Nvidia as "G-Sync Compatible." So the choice may not be as black and white (or as red or green) as it has been for years.

Upgrading a Pre-Built Desktop With a New Graphics Card
Assuming the chassis is big enough, most pre-built desktops these days have enough cooling capability to accept a new discrete GPU with no problems.

The first thing to do before buying or upgrading a GPU is to measure the inside of your chassis for the available card space. In some cases, you've got a gulf between the far right-hand edge of the motherboard and the hard drive bays. In others, you might have barely an inch. (See our favorite graphics cards for compact PCs.)

Next, check your graphics card's height. The card partners sometimes field their own card coolers that depart from the standard AMD and Nvidia reference designs. Make certain that if your chosen card has an elaborate cooler design, it's not so tall that it keeps your case from closing.

MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Gaming X Trio 3

Finally: the power supply unit (PSU). Your system needs to have a PSU that's up to the task of giving a new card enough juice. This is something to be especially wary of if you're putting a high-end video card in a pre-built PC that was equipped with a low-end card, or no card at all. Doubly so if it's a budget-minded or business system; these PCs tend to have underpowered or minimally provisioned PSUs.

The two most important factors to be aware of here are the number of six-pin and eight-pin cables on your PSU, and the maximum wattage the PSU is rated for. Most modern systems, including those sold by OEMs like Dell, HP, and Lenovo, employ power supplies that include at least one six-pin power connector meant for a video card, and some have both a six-pin and an eight-pin connector. Midrange and high-end graphics cards will require a six-pin cable, an eight-pin cable, or some combination of the two to provide working power to the card. (The lowest-end cards draw all the power they need from the PCI Express slot.) Make sure you know what your card needs in terms of connectors.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Founders Edition 13

Nvidia and AMD both outline recommended power supply wattage for each of their graphics-card families. Take these guidelines seriously, but they are just guidelines, and they are generally conservative. If AMD or Nvidia says you need at least a 500-watt PSU to run a given GPU, don't chance it with the 300-watter you may have installed, but know that you don't need an 800-watt PSU to guarantee enough headroom, either.

Ports and Preferences: Understanding Video Card Connections
Three kinds of port are common on the rear edge of a current graphics card: DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort. Some systems and monitors still use DVI, but it's the oldest of the three standards and is being phased out on many high-end cards here in 2019.

Most cards have several DisplayPorts (often three) and one HDMI port. When it comes to HDMI versus DisplayPort, note some differences. First, if you plan on using a 4K display, now or in the future, your card needs to at least support HDMI 2.0a or DisplayPort 1.2/1.2a. It's fine if the GPU supports anything above those labels, like HDMI 2.0b or DisplayPort 1.4, but that's the minimum you'll want for smooth 4K playback or gaming. (The latest-gen cards from both makers will be fine on this score.)

Image: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition-15.jpg

Also, for now, only DisplayPort 1.4 will support 4K gaming at anything above 60Hz, and DisplayPort is also the only way you'll be able to push 1440p resolution above 60Hz with G-Sync turned on. You should guarantee you're buying a card with at least DisplayPort 1.4-out if you plan to use either of these resolutions above the 60Hz threshold with G-Sync enabled.

Note that some of the very latest cards from Nvidia in its GeForce RTX series employ a new port, called VirtualLink. This port looks like (and can serve as) a USB Type-C port that also supports DisplayPort over USB-C. What the port is really designed for, though: attaching future generations of virtual-reality (VR) headsets, providing power and bandwidth adequate to the needs of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs). It's nice to have, but no VR hardware supports it yet.

Looking Forward: Graphics Card Trends
Nvidia has been in the consumer video card driver's seat for a few years now, but 2019 should see more action than any in recent memory to shake things up between the two big players.

GeForce Vs. Radeon: Looking Ahead
If your goal is a high-end graphics card (we define that, these days, as cards at $500 or more) for playing games at 4K, and you plan to use the card for three to five years, the upper end of the market is mostly Nvidia's game at the moment. But that could shift as 2019 progresses, with AMD's next-generation "Navi" cards expected later this year. Based on a new 7nm manufacturing process, these cards could change AMD's fortunes in the graphics space. The Radeon VII, its first 7nm-built video card, is a competent offering for 1440p/4K play and content creators, but it doesn't quite topple the RTX 2080 in most respects. (See our face-off AMD Radeon VII vs. Nvidia RTX 2080: Which High-End Gaming Card to Buy?)

AMD Radeon VII video card

VR: New Interfaces, New HMDs?
As we alluded to with VirtualLink, VR is another consideration. VR's requirements are slightly different than those of simple monitors. Both of the mainstream VR HMDs, the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, have an effective resolution across both eyes of 2,160 by 1,200. That's significantly lower than 4K, and it's the reason why midrange GPUs like AMD's Radeon RX 580 or Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060 can be used for VR. On the other hand, VR demands higher frame rates than conventional gaming. Low frame rates in VR (anything below 90 frames per second is considered low) can result in a bad gaming experience. Higher-end GPUs in the $300-plus category are going to offer better VR experiences today and more longevity overall, but VR with current-generation headsets can be sustained on a lower-end card than 4K. Coming cards in 2019, we suspect, may push the VR bar lower.

That said, as the year progresses we're going to see at least two new headsets that up the power requirements. The Oculus Rift S, due to hit store shelves in May, will raise the bar to a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440, while the hotly anticipated Valve Index should release shortly after with an increased resolution, as well. No firm details on exactly what kind of pixel density the Index will push, but expect it to at least meet the Rift S, if not exceed it when it hits shelves sometime in Q2.

High-Refresh: A New Frontier for Serious Gamers
Finally, bear in mind a further trend gaining momentum on the monitor side of things: high-refresh gaming monitors. For ages, 60Hz (or 60 screen redraws a second) was the panel-refresh ceiling for most PC monitors. We're seeing the emergence of lots of models now with higher refresh ceilings, designed especially for gamers. These panels may support up to 120Hz, 144Hz, or more for smoother gameplay. (This ability can also be piggybacked with FreeSync or G-Sync adaptive sync to enable smooth frame rates when the card is pushed to its limit.)

What this means: If you have a video card that can consistently push frames in a given game in excess of 60fps, you may be able to see those formerly "wasted" frames in the form of smoother game motion. Most casual gamers won't care, but the difference is marked if you play fast-action titles, and competitive e-sports hounds will find the fluidity a competitive advantage. (See our picks for the best gaming monitors, including high-refresh models.) In short: Buying a powerful video card that pushes high frame rates can be a boon nowadays even for play at a pedestrian resolution like 1080p, if paired with a high-refresh monitor. High-refresh/high-detail gaming at 4K, though, is still beyond today's cards in the most demanding games.

 best graphics card for 2019

The best graphics card is a relative conversation; there are, of course, objective metrics for performance by which you can measure a GPU's strength, but a lot of which video card is best for you comes down to your needs and budget. Do you crave all the raw, unchecked power of Nvidia's RTX 2080 Ti? Or are you looking for ray tracing on a budget, something like the RTX 2060?  It's not just about raw horsepower, there's also the all-important value conversation, which graphics card is going to push the most frames per dollar, and on the budget end there the best ratio comes by way of the new Nvidia Geforce GTX 1660 or perhaps AMD's Radeon RX 580. 

Of course, getting the best graphics card is only part of the battle—you'll want to pair it with the best CPU for gaming. And for those critical final touches, you'll need the best gaming mouse and best gaming keyboard to complete your beautiful rig.

BEST DEAL TODAY



The RX 590 8GB is a powerful card for 1080p gaming and can even dip into the 1440p realm, with performance just ahead of Nvidia's new 1660 in large part due to it's 8 GB of VRAM. Knocking $60 off the price makes it pretty irresistible.

So where do you start when you're shopping for the best graphics card in 2019? Your top consideration is what you'll primarily be using your GPU for. If you need a video card to power high end, triple-A titles like Metro Exodus at 4K Ultra, you'll want to invest in at least an RTX 2080. But if you're mostly going to be using one of the best gaming PCs for less demanding games like Apex Legends or Fortnite, you can easily skate by with a much cheaper graphics card like the 1050 Ti or the RX 580.

Fastest graphics card aroundRay tracing and deep learning techTItan pricing on GeForceNo ray traced games yet
Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the latest and most potent GPU around, and it's also one of the largest consumer GPUs ever produced. The Turing TU102 is 60 percent larger than the Pascal GP102 in the 1080 Ti, with 55 percent more transistors. Those extra transistors went into more CUDA cores, but Nvidia didn't stop there, adding in Tensor cores to help accelerate deep learning algorithms like DLSS, plus RT cores to accelerate ray tracing.

There are plenty of other enhancements in the Turing architecture as well, but if you want the best, be prepared to shell out: the cheapest 2080 Ti cards start at $999, with many selling for $1,199 and up. Technically there's also the Titan RTX, which more than doubles the price of the 2080 Ti, but it's more of a prosumer card that anything we'd recommend for pure gaming purposes.

If you're looking for the best value, forget about the new RTX cards. On the other hand, if you're eyeing a 4k 144Hz HDR G-Sync display and you want the absolute fastest graphics card around, this is the card for you. You could even try adding a second card and using an NVLink connector, assuming you just won the lottery. We're unlikely to see anything substantially faster for at least a year, so you'll be able to sit comfortably at the top of the pecking order for a while.

Ray tracing and deep learningPotential to become even faster1440p ray tracing needs DLSSMore expensive than the 1080 Ti
Sure, the RTX 2080 Ti is the fastest graphics card and has all sorts of cool and potentially useful features, but at the current prices it's a tough pill to swallow. Dropping down to the RTX 2080 will get you still excellent performance—it's the second fastest consumer GPU, edging out the GTX 1080 Ti—and save over $300. And you still get the same ray tracing and deep learning (eg, DLSS) features, albeit not quite as many of each core type.

The one major caveat right now is the same as above, we're still waiting for games that enable ray tracing effects and DLSS. Those should start arriving in the next month or so with a Shadow of the Tomb Raider patch and Battlefield 5, but will the RTX 2080 be powerful enough to use the new features? Most likely not at maximum resolution and quality, but hopefully we'll be able to run at a reduced quality ray tracing mode that will look nearly as good and perform better.

Good performanceBetter pricing than other modelsNot much faster than GTX 1080Waiting for DLSS games
The ray tracing future may sound great, but what if you can't afford $700 or more on a graphics card? That's where Nvidia's RTX 2070 enters the picture, the third Turing GPU and the most affordable of the bunch. More importantly, it's relatively widely available, and there are even a few cards at the base recommended price of $500. That's still a lot of money for a graphics card, and the 2070 is actually slower than the previous generation 1080 Ti (see below), at least in games that don't support DLSS—which is everything for the time being, though that should start to change soon.

The RTX 2070 effectively takes over where the GTX 1080 left off. It offers slightly better performance for the same price, and like the other RTX cards it features the new Tensor and RT cores. The Founders Edition wasn't particularly impressive, given its $100 price premium, but we liked the EVGA 2070 Black quite a bit and it makes for a fine addition to any new gaming PC. The Gigabyte 2070 Windforce and Asus 2070 Turbo are two more options to consider, and all the 2070 GPUs tend to reach similar maximum overclocks.

Great for 1080p and 1440p gamingAffordably priced RTX featuresStruggles in ray tracing gamesSideways step from GTX 1070 Ti
The best graphics card isn't simply the fastest graphics card, or the cheapest graphics card. Instead, the best graphics card needs to balance performance, price, and features. There are many great graphics cards, but for a great GPU that won't break the bank, Nvidia's RTX 2060 is probably the best option. It delivers performance roughly equal to the outgoing GTX 1070 Ti, with a lower price, plus all the new RTX features.

If you want to play games at 1080p or 1440p on a 144Hz display, the RTX 2060 has the chops to handle most games at close to high to ultra quality. Unless you enable ray tracing in games that support it, at which point it tends to come up short. Still, with a retail price of $350, it's hard not to like the RTX 2060. About the only thing threatening its price/performance ratio is the GTX 1660 Ti.

Great performanceSuitable for 1440pCan be quite power hungryArchitecture showing its age
We had high hopes for Vega prior to its launch, and ultimately it couldn't live up to the hype. Instead of being the Titan-killer we hoped for, the Vega 64 and Vega 56 failed to take down even Nvidia's year-old GTX 1080 / 1070. But they come close, often leading in DirectX 12 games, and at least prices are affordable these days. Plus you can make the argument of supporting the underdog to prevent an Nvidia monopoly.

Out of the Vega offerings, the RX Vega 56 is the better buy at current prices, and it will usually handle modern games at 1440p and maybe even 4k. Where it comes up short is in efficiency: the Vega 56 often uses as much power as a GTX 1080 Ti, with performance closer to the new RTX 2060. It's not just about power and heat, but noise levels and longevity. More power on the GPU means more power on the PSU, which means both have fans that need to spin faster. We really want an RTX competitor from AMD, but unfortunately the Radeon VII isn't it. Until AMD's Navi ships in late 2019, the Vega 56 remains a good upper midrange value.

Excellent performance at 1080pVery efficient designOnly 6GB VRAMNo RTX features
Nvidia's latest GPU is the GTX 1660 Ti, sort of an odd departure for the new Turing architecture as Nvidia removed (or at least disabled) the ray tracing and deep learning hardware that has so far been the focus of a lot of hype, not to mention a little controversy. But along with dropping those features Nvidia delivers a lower priced and impressively efficient design. It mostly takes over from the previous GTX 1060 cards, with more bandwidth and better performance at a similar price. In fact, it's almost a direct replacement in performance for the GTX 1070.

There are a few minor drawbacks, however, like sticking with 6GB of VRAM. Yes, the GDDR6 memory delivers 50 percent more bandwidth than the 1060 6GB GDDR5, but some newer games are starting to push beyond 6GB at some settings. There's also the missing RTX features. Ray tracing and DLSS might not seem like such a big deal right now, but $70 more gets you the faster and potentially more capable RTX 2060. But if you don't want to go about $300, the GTX 1660 Ti is a great graphics card.

Good price and performanceEfficient and quietNeeds lower settings in some gamesNot a massive improvement over the 1060
The arrival of Nvidia's new GeForce GTX 1660 has basically ended the era of the GTX 1060 as the most popular mainstream gaming solution. Or at least, the 1060 cards are no longer in contention, as they've been discontinued, though tens of millions were sold.

For roughly the same price as the outgoing 1060 6GB, the new 1660 boosts performance by about 10-15 percent. That puts it ahead of the RX 580 and tied with the RX 590, and it's a more efficient card as well. You'll typically only need a single 6-pin connection to power the GTX 1660.

The loss of 2GB VRAM relative to the RX 590/580 isn't really a concern in most games, especially at 1080p, which is where these cards do best. 1440p is possible, but only at sometimes significantly lower quality settings. But while Nvidia wins on efficiency, the RX 580 and 570 remain exceptional values for budget minded gamers.

Good value and performance for 1080p8GB of VRAMUses more power than GTX 1660Same old Polaris architecture
Originally a $280 graphics card, the RX 590 now routinely sells for $220. That makes a world of difference in value, and performance is still good. The GTX 1660 is roughly tied with the RX 590, at the same price, and it's a more efficient card. However, there are games where the 6GB on the Nvidia card can be a bit limiting. We rate the RX 590 just ahead of the 1660 for performance, though that's splitting hairs.

Compared to the older RX 580 8GB, the new revision has higher clockspeeds that boost performance by 15 percent. That's thanks to a refined '12nm' process, as otherwise the architecture remains effectively the same. The price is also about 20 percent higher, but if you're looking at total system cost and not just the graphics card, we recommend faster GPUs even if they cost more. Just make sure you have a PSU with a the necessary 8-pin and 6-pin power connections that most 590 cards use.

Excellent performance at 1080pUsually faster in DX12 gamesUses more power than GTX 1060/1660
Many gamers are on a budget, and while faster cards might make you envious, if you're running a 1080p display they're often overkill. Mainstream GPUs like the RX 570/580 and GTX 1660/1060 often have sales dropping below MSRP. Nvidia's new 16-series cards might be faster, but the RX 580 8GB typically beats the GTX 1060 6GB for around $180.

That hits the sweet spot for mainstream gamers, undercutting both GTX 1660/1060 models as well as AMD's own RX 590. The 590 mentioned above is certainly worth a look, but the 580 8GB remains one of the best values in graphics cards.

Good for 1080p gamingOften faster in DX12Uses more power than GTX 1660/1060Only 4GB VRAM
AMD's Polaris architecture has been around a while, and there are rumors circulating that we may see an updated architecture this summer (Navi), but we'll have to wait and see. The RX 570 4GB has now dropped well below its original $169 target, and if you're looking for a 1080p card you really won't find a better bargain.

Overall, the RX 570 4GB typically comes out slightly ahead of the GTX 1060 3GB, and while it does use a bit more power, it costs less than Nvidia's substantially slower GTX 1050 Ti. Most desktops are more than capable of running this 150W card without any difficulty, though you'll need at least a 6-pin power connector, or possibly an 8-pin connector. As long as your PSU is up to snuff, the RX 570 pretty much kills off the market for anything lower.



How we test graphics cards and performance
While the CPU is still the 'brain' of your PC, dozens of games every year will push your graphics card to its limits. It's the component you'll want to upgrade most frequently, but if you buy the right card, it should last you at least two years. For gaming systems, it's also likely the most expensive part in your build. On a practical budget, it's critical to find the graphics card with the best ratio of price to performance. That's why we've previously looked at cards in the $300/£250 range, though the best values are currently either above or below that mark.

For raw performance, Nvidia's RTX 2080 Ti is a killer card, easily outperforming all older cards. It's also modestly overclockable, quiet, and reasonably efficient. But it costs an arm and a leg. You can argue about whether you really need ultra quality or what resolution to run, but your wallet will likely end up pointing you at cards in the $200-$350 range. That's why the RTX 2060 is such an impressive card, even if it's not the fastest new kid on the block.

We recommend the RTX 2060, or maybe the RTX 2070, to most—but not all—PC gamers, it's not the only option worth considering. Performance scales with price as you move up the ladder, but near the top you get greatly diminishing returns. The same goes for moving down to the ladder, though: go too low and while the price might look good, performance could leave you wanting. So we factor in all of these elements when reviewing and recommending graphics cards.

Do you need a new graphics card?

If you're doubtful that your current PC is fast enough to warrant purchasing a better graphics card, I have some data for you. Even with the fastest graphics card around, running at a resolution that puts more of the burden on your CPU (1080p ultra), there's often only a minor improvement in gaming performance. Yes, truly old CPUs are going to struggle, but going from a Core i7-4770K to a Core i7-8700K only improves gaming performance by 23 percent on average.

What happens if you use a graphics card that's 20-30 percent slower than a GTX 1080 Ti? Your CPU becomes even less of a factor. If you have at least 8GB of system memory and a Core i7-4770K or better CPU, you should be fine with everything up to about the GTX 1070 Ti / RX Vega 56 level of performance. We wouldn't recommend buying an i7-4770K these days, however, so when it comes time to upgrade look at our choice for the best CPU for gaming.

Don't be fooled into thinking VRAM capacity is more important than the GPU, either. It can be a factor, but slower GPUs with 4GB VRAM usually can't handle settings that actually need 4GB VRAM, and games that need 8GB will also tend to favor GPUs closer to the RTX 2080 than the RX 580. There's also very little (if any) discernible difference in most games when switching from 2GB to 4GB textures, never mind 4GB to 8GB. All the cards we've selected have at least 4GB, which is more than sufficient for high quality, and it's usually enough for ultra settings as well. 

Testing graphics cards

Our graphics card recommendations are based on our own extensive benchmarks and testing, and then factoring in the price. We have benchmark data for the complete range of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, including all the RTX 20-series, GTX 10-series and AMD Radeon VII, RX Vega, and RX 500 series. We've previously looked at the R9 Fury/300/200 series and GTX 900/700 series, but due to time constraints and availability we're no longer actively testing most of these cards. However, I've included one or two representatives from each generation as a point of reference.

A WORD ABOUT SLI AND CROSSFIRE
If you're looking for maximum performance, you can run two cards in SLI or CrossFire. However, it's becoming increasingly common for major games to completely ignore multi-GPU users. You don't absolutely need dual x16 connections, though it can boost performance by a few percent in some games. Also of note is that our tests indicate AMD's Ryzen parts don't scale in SLI/CF performance nearly as well as Intel's Core processors.

Graphics performance isn't the only consideration. The quality of game drivers and other features supported by the card are important. The card's noise level, power draw, and temperature matter, too. Thankfully, nearly all modern cards are fairly quiet, even under load, and temperatures are within the acceptable range as well, though Nvidia still has an advantage when it comes to power.

We test each card on a high-end PC at 1080p medium, 1080p ultra, 1440p ultra, and 4K with ultra/high settings. We take the results from fifteen games, mostly newer releases, using the 'best' API for each GPU on each game. That means low-level APIs are used for AMD cards if they're available, while DX12/Vulkan are only used in certain games for Nvidia cards.

Here's how the cards stack up in terms of average and minimum frame rates across these games. You can see individual game charts including most of these GPUs in our GTX 1660 Ti review.

[Performance charts updated as of April 12, 2019]

Nvidia claims most of the top spots for performance, with the new Radeon VII coming in below the RTX 2080 RTX 2080 and GTX 1080 Ti, but above the RTX 2070. That's how far behind AMD is, unfortunately: its latest $700 graphics card ends up being a hair slower than Nvidia's 2-year-old $700 card. That's probably also a big part of why the RTX cards cost so much more than their 'equivalent' 10-series counterparts.

But you don't need to buy at the top of the chart to get good performance, as mainstream cards like the RX 570/580 and GTX 1060 3GB/6GB are still totally viable, and the GTX 970/980 and R9 Fury X/390 don't look too shabby either. They might not do so well at 1440p ultra, but they're more than capable of running most games at 1080p medium to high quality, sometimes more.

But how do these cards compare in terms of value? Here's a look at fps per monetary unit, for cards that can still be purchased new at retail (eg, not the GTX 1080 Ti through GTX 1070).

In terms of best value, we've provided two different looks at what the cards offer. The top charts show the graphics cards in isolation, which can be useful if you have a PC and you're only looking to upgrade your GPU. The bottom charts look at framerates in terms of total system cost, using a decent (i7-8700K) build as a reference point. Neither approach is a perfect, but the two give a range of how the cards rate in terms of value.

The markets change the picture slightly, but the RX 570 / 580 / 590 / Vega 65 and GTX 1660 / 1060 cards are consistently at the top of the GPU charts, with the more expensive GPUs like the Radeon VII and RTX 2080 Ti falling to the bottom. The problem is that while budget and midrange GPUs on their own may look good, combine it with system price, especially on a powerful modern PC, and you're almost always better off putting more money into your graphics card.

Notice that for our roughly $800 build (minus the GPU—the build is similar to our high-end gaming PC build guide but with less storage capacity), the more expensive cards are at the top. But whichever chart you look at, keep in mind the types of games you want to play as well as your monitor, because higher resolution displays tend to need more powerful GPUs.

Wrapping it up

Looking forward, computer graphics is a fast-changing field. AMD just released the first ever 7nm GPU, but it certainly won't be the last. Still, it may be a year or more before Nvidia joins the 7nm party. Our recommendations are based off performance combined with current prices, and price cuts or a limited time sale could easily move a card to the top of the list.

If you find your current system isn't keeping up with the gaming times, look at the performance charts and decide how far up the ladder you're looking to climb, then buy accordingly. Those who already own an R9 390 or GTX 970 or better should still be able to run any current game, though not necessarily at 60 fps and maximum quality. Games continue to push for new levels of performance, but tuning a few settings should keep most graphics cards viable for at least a few years.

Some online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links. Read our affiliate policy for more info.

Ray traced 1080p gamingRuns coolMore expensive than previous gen
When Nvidia’s Turing cards started rolling out, we couldn’t help but balk at the high prices. However, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 turns things around, bringing value to the Turing lineup – or, at least, more value than what was there already. The RTX 2060 is already popular, due to the fact that it can handle pretty much anything at 1080p (or even 1440p) at max settings. And, there’s also the fact that it’s the most affordable way to experience RTX features, well, as long as you stick to 1080p.

 High fps 4K gaming  Spearheading ray tracing revolution  Extremely expensive 
If you’re looking for the best graphics card, and you’re not ok with compromising, you may want to consider the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Without a doubt, this is the most powerful graphics card you can buy without going for a professional solution. And, especially now that games like Battlefield V and Metro Exodus actually use the RTX features, there’s never been a better time to jump on the raytraced bandwagon. Just brace yourself for that price tag.

Handles both 1440p and 4K gamingLower power consumptionToo expensive
If you want to stick to QHD, with some brief forays into 4K, you might want to check out the RTX 2070. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 brings the new Turing architecture to the mid range with performance that dwarfs the GTX 1070 that came before. Not only will you be able to play everything at 1440p, but you’re going to get insane performance – up to 120fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. However, you should consider that the RTX 2070 is significantly more expensive than its predecessor, so that trade off in price-to-performance may not be worth it – especially if you’re coming from a Pascal card.

AffordableExcellent 1080p performanceLimited memory bandwidth
When Nvidia first launched its Turing lineup, it was hard to find a model that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. However, with the launch of the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, and specifically the PNY XLR8 Gaming OC model, next-generation performance is attainable for everyone. You won’t be able to do 4K 60 fps gaming with this card, but it’s absolutely perfect for anyone still using a 1080p panel. At that resolution, you’ll have trouble running into any title that slows you down. There aren’t any RTX features here, but since there are only a few games that use them, that’s not really a dealbreaker.

Best graphics card for creatives: AMD Radeon VII
The first 7nm graphics card is a powerhouse

Stream Processors: 3,840 | Core Clock: 1,400MHz (1,800MHz boost) | Memory: 16GB HBM2 | Memory Clock: 2Gbps | Power Connectors: 2 x 8-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0

Plenty of VRAM Runs cool Weak DirectX 12 performance

We’ve been waiting for a new high-end graphics card from AMD since 2017’s Radeon Vega 64, but a lot has happened in the graphics market since then – namely Nvidia Turing. And, with the AMD Radeon VII, Team Red wanted to reclaim a piece of the high-end graphics pie, and it largely succeeded. The AMD Radeon VII holds its own in 4K gaming, but it particularly excels in content creation. Packed with 16GB of HBM2 memory, the AMD Radeon VII can compete with much more expensive creative-focused cards.

World’s smallest 1080 TiSLI supportInferior performanceRuns hot and loud
If you’re setting out to build a microATX or a mini-ITX gaming PC, you shouldn’t have to settle for a low-end GPU. You can find mini graphics cards like the Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini. And, sure it’s not the latest and greatest GPU out there anymore, but the 1080 Ti has a lot of life left in it. Plus, when you can get that power in a card that’s just 211 x 125 x 41mm, the loss in performance is totally worth the beautiful mini PC you’ll get.



Best Budget graphics card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G
The best bargain graphics card, perhaps ever

Stream Processors: 1,408 | Core Clock: 1,530MHz | Memory: 6GB GDDR5 | Memory Speed: 8Gbps | Power Connectors: 1 x 8-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0

Extremely affordableGreat entry-level performance GDDR5 memory
These days, with all the expensive graphics cards, more budget-friendly products sometimes slip through the cracks. We think that’s a shame. The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 deserves all the spotlights, delivering fantastic 1080p performance at a budget price. With the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 OC 6G, you’re also getting a healthy factory overclock and all the outputs you’ll ever need, so you can play all your favorite games and have plenty of monitors attached. We’d call that a bargain, maybe the best we’ve ever had.

Solid 1080p performerGood overclocking potentialGreater than 75W TDP
Any eSports player will tell you that high frame rates are far more important than beautifully rendered graphical details – and that’s where the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti shines. In a time where graphics cards cost as much as rent, it’s an affordable, but potent GPU that can play most eSports games well above 60fps. It’s a bit pricier than the lower-end Nvidia GTX 1050, but you’ll appreciate the extra power behind this card to play future eSports titles, as well as the odd AAA title.

Now Reading: The best graphics cards for 2019
COMPUTING
The best graphics cards for 2019
Upgrade your gaming rig with our favorite graphics cards for every budget
By	Jon Martindale	— Posted on	April 30, 2019 11:00AM PST
  
 
A good graphics card is the most important part of a gaming PC. The best one right now is the AMD Radeon VII . It might be expensive, but it’s incredibly powerful when it comes to rendering games, and it’s fantastic at productivity tasks too. We test graphics cards extensively in both benchmarks and in-game testing to see which provides the best performance for the price. The Radeon VII just barely beats out the competition, which is an impressive win for Team Red.

But the Radeon VII isn’t the only graphics card worth considering. We’ve included options below for ultimate 4K power, as well as a good alternative for budget gamers.

AMD RADEON VII
The best
AMD Radeon VII
Riley Young/Digital Trends
Why should you buy this: The Radeon Vega VII offers fantastic performance at a competitive, if high, price.

AMD Radeon VII
With 16GB of HBM2 and high clock speeds, the Radeon VII is fantastic for work and play.
$699 FROM AMD
Who’s it for: Deep-pocket gamers and UHD video editors who don’t care about ray tracing.

Why we picked the AMD Radeon VII:

AMD’s new, second-generation Vega graphics card, the Radeon VII, might not have some of the bells and whistles of Nvidia’s RTX-line of GPUs, but what it lacks in features, it makes up for in raw power.

Sucking in as much as 300 watts alone, you wouldn’t know that this GPU is running on an efficient and small-scale, 7nm node. That’s several orders of magnitude smaller than both its predecessor, the Vega 64, and Nvidia’s stiff competition. Where it lacks finesse in cooling and subsequently noise-levels, though, the Radeon VII delivers severe performance improvements over its first-generation counterpart and in many cases, Nvidia’s best too.

In our testing we found the Radeon VII to be a solid competitor for the RTX 2080 and even the 2080 Ti in some cases. While that latter card is still more powerful in general (see below) the Radeon VII beats out the 2080 in most of our gaming tests and with its massive 16GB of HBM2 graphics memory, it’s a fantastic card for compute workloads too. As always, results will vary depending on your system, but in our Threadripper-based PC, it beats the competition.

Near perfect for work and play, the Radeon VII is our card to buy if you can afford its steep $700 price point.

If you can’t stretch your budget that far, the RTX 2060 offers serious power and value for money at around half the price. The 1660 Ti is a worthy contender too, but it falls behind on features and performance.

NVIDIA GTX 2080 TI
The best graphics card for 4K
nvidia geforce rtx 2080 vs ti
Why should you buy this: You want to play the latest games at the highest frame rate and resolution.

Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti
Although expensive, the RTX 2080 Ti is the best 4K gaming card available today.
$1,475 FROM WALMART
Who’s it for: 4K monitor owners and PC gaming enthusiasts.

Why we picked the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti:

There’s nothing budget-friendly about the massive GTX 2080 Ti. Aside from the Nvidia RTX Titan, which is even more absurdly expensive and not that much faster, the RTX 2080 Ti is the most powerful consumer offering currently available in Nvidia’s arsenal, and it shows in its gaming performance.

Other cards in its range, like the 2080, AMD’s Radeon VII, and the 1080 Ti, remain viable cards for delivering 4K resolution, but the 2080 Ti offers much greater performance potential whether you’re gaming at just 4K resolution, or want to bring in some of the additional visual features of the Turing generation of cards, like DLSS and ray tracing. Considering how hardware intensive the latter of those two features is, if you want to take full advantage of everything modern games like Battlefield V have to offer, the 2080 Ti delivers the best frame rates and the best overall experience.

When put through its paces, we found the RTX 2080 Ti capable of delivering more than 12,000 points in 3DMark Time Spy. It also hit more than 100 FPS in Battlefield 1 at 4K with all settings at Ultra, and even hit near 50 FPS at 4K in the always-taxing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

If you can find a 1080 Ti at a reasonable price, it’s still a viable alternative (and the 2080 isn’t a bad choice either), but the 2080 Ti is head and shoulders above them in terms of its raw power and graphical capabilities.

AMD RX 570
The best entry-level graphics card
amd radeon rx 570 inhand2
Bill Roberson/Digital Trends
Why should you buy this: You want to turn a PC without a GPU into a certified gaming rig.

Asus Radeon RX 570
Compact and lightweight, the RX 570 packs a surprising punch at 1080p, without breaking the bank.
$276 FROM WALMART
Who’s it for: Casual and occasional gamers.

Why we picked the AMD RX 570:

With a lack of affordable mid-range graphics options in Nvidia’s new RTX generation at the time of writing, we are restricted to what are effectively, last-generation solutions from both it and AMD. Although the RTX 2060 is an expensive option, we have typically recommended the GTX 1050 as a good starting point for entry-level gaming. However, AMD’s recent price reductions have made some of its cards much more competitive.

The RX 560 is a little too weak for us to easily recommend, but the RX 570 is more affordable today than ever before and offers fantastic performance at its new price point. You might be wondering about some of the newer entries in the RX lineup like the RX 580 or 590. They’re both solid midrange GPUs, but until prices come down a bit more, the 570 is the best starter card.

Currently available at well under $200 at a few retailers (with free games), the RX 570 delivers credible 1080p gaming performance that isn’t a million miles away from what its more capable big brother, the RX 580 can put out. In our testing, the RX 570 was able to output near 90 FPS in Battlefield 1 at 1080p with all settings on ultra – a higher frame rate than the RX 480 or even Zotac’s GTX 1060.

Even more taxing games like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided proved perfectly playable at Ultra quality levels at 1080p, with average frame rates of 44 FPS.

The RX 580 is a viable alternative if you have a little more money to burn as it does represent a nice uptick in performance, but bang for buck, the RX 570 is our card of choice for kicking in the door of high-fidelity PC gaming. If you want to wait a little, Nvidia now has the GTX 1660 Ti available, but it’s nowhere near as affordable as the RX 570.

In Nvidia’s camp the 16-series is worth considering, but make sure you stick to the basic versions without fancy cooling or overclocks. The base 1660 is a decent performer, but it loses its value quickly as the price increases.

Razer Blade 2019 review
Dan Baker/Digital Trends
Why should you buy this: It offers great performance without adding undue bulk to modern laptops.

Razer Blade 15.6" Gaming Laptop
The 2080 Max-Q makes the Razer Blade a powerful but trim gaming laptop that can play just about everything.
$3,000 FROM RAZER
Who’s it for: Power gamers on the move.

Why we picked the Nvidia RTX 2080 Max-Q:

Nvidia’s RTX 2080 Max-Q is the latest iteration of its leaner mobile gaming solutions, but that doesn’t mean it lacks power. It offers greater numbers of CUDA cores than its 10-series Max-Q counterparts and that ends up delivering a sizable performance improvement over the past generation.

Although the RTX 2080 Max-Q falls behind its full scale desktop and mobile counterparts, its real strength lies in not outputting anywhere near the kind of heat of those big scale GPUs do. That means that you’ll still find the RTX 2080 Max-Q in laptops that are sleek and thin and don’t weigh too much. The Asus Zephyrus GX701 that we used in our testing weighs less than six pounds and offers performance that in years gone by you’d only find in chunky gaming machines that weigh at least 50 percent more than that.

There are some solid alternatives in this space with both AMD and Nvidia offering mobile options with greater and lesser performance depending on your needs, but for our money, the RTX 2080 Max-Q provides the best blend of performance and compatibility with the kind of thin and light laptops that have come to dominate the gaming and general purpose notebook scene in recent years.

WHAT ABOUT AMD VEGA 56/64, NAVI?
As much as AMD has notched up a couple of solid entries on our best graphics card list, astute readers or AMD fans may have noticed a lack of first-generation Vega and AMD’s upcoming Navi graphics cards. Why is that?

Don’t get us wrong, the AMD Vega 56 and 64 with their newly reduced pricing still represent great graphics cards, especially in comparison to the last remaining Nvidia GTX 10-series GPUs that some retailers still hold stock of. However, they fall well behind the top RTX graphics cards and AMD’s own Radeon VII.

Their bang for buck isn’t bad, but considering the advanced features offered by other RTX cards and the greater value to be had from AMD’s other cards, they don’t quite make the cut of the “best” graphics cards. They’re good, just not great.

As for Navi, we don’t know exactly what it will be like, but the latest rumors suggest that it will offer Vega-like performance at a much more affordable price point. That could mean they end up replacing our recommendations for best budget and bang for buck cards, but it’s unlikely Navi will unseat Nvidia’s most powerful graphics cards when it comes to 4K gaming – at least initially.

None of AMD’s cards support Nvidia’s newly-pushed ray tracing or DLSS features either, so there is an argument to be made that Nvidia cards offer the most visual features. However, with a limited number of games supporting those new technologies at this time, the jury is still out on whether they will become mainstay gaming features, or more niche offerings for Nvidia users only.

How we test
When we test graphics cards, we tend to focus on three major factors: Feature set, performance, and price.

Feature set is often determined by brand and platform, which we always consider as we review a card. It’s not just about whether it can handle a virtual reality headset, or how many monitors it supports. We check out graphical standard and API support, and special features like Nvidia’s Ansel, or AMD’s WattMan overclocking software.

Of course, performance is key. We run review units through a series of synthetic and real-world benchmarks, even beyond those we report. We keep detailed records of frame rate trends, frame times, and any anomalous metrics, like noise, heat, or artifacts.

Ultimately, it all comes down to cash. With so many GPUs, board partners, and differences in clock speed and memory, there’s no shortage of options, and it’s all too easy to overpay. We check the price of each individual card, and even help determine availability at launch.

Best Graphics Card 2019: Will AMD’s rumoured Navi GPU be a match for Nvidia’s Turing?
Ryan Jones 
Ryan Jones
April 8, 2019 5:27 pm BST
  

 Best list
Graphics cards are the most important PC component when it comes to building your gaming rig. They’re also the most expensive. Given the importance of such a buying decision, we’ve created this guide so you can buy the very best graphics card for you. 

It’s no easy task finding the right card though, with the range of prices and features greater than ever before. Not only do you have to consider raw performance and what resolution you plan on playing at, but you also need to determine whether you fancy exciting new features such as ray tracing and DLSS.

Ray tracing is a new feature that enables video game developers to create more realistic reflections and light simulation. This means reflections in puddles and light shining through a window will look far more impressive than with traditional rendering methods. Currently, only Nvidia’s RTX cards support this technology, but Nvidia will be rolling it out this month to GTX cards, but at a far lower quality.

DLSS, meanwhile, is a another RTX exclusive feature which use artificial intelligence to help the GPU render frames more efficiently, resulting in a juicy frame rate boost.

If you’re keen to get access to these features and money is no object then the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the best graphics card you can buy right now. This card can play most triple-A games in 4K at 60fps and supports real-time ray tracing.

If you’re after a bargain and only care about Full HD gaming then the newly launched GTX 1660 Ti is the best value graphics card we’ve tested at just £260. And while this card doesn’t have RT Cores and Tensors Cores, it will still be capable of ray tracing from April – as will every other GTX graphics card – thanks to an upcoming Nvidia driver update.

Of course, RTX cards will still likely be supremely better at ray tracing than their GTX counterparts, so if you want a quality performance for light effects and reflections you’re going to need to upgrade. The cheapest RTX card available is the RTX 2060, offering fantastic value given its kick ass performance.

Before you go investing in a Nvidia graphics card though, bear in mind that reports indicate we’ll soon see the reveal of AMD Navi. This is AMD’s next-gen GPU with (reportedly) 7-nanometre architecture. Little else has been confirmed so far, but expect an official reveal during Computex 2019 in May.

How we test graphics cards

Each new card is plugged into Trusted Reviews’ test rig, which uses a set of uniform components that we believe is representative of most PC gamers at the time. Next, we use a series of synthetic and gaming benchmarks to discover the frame rate at which the card will play modern triple-A games at varying resolutions.

We then checkout the potential for overclocking and a card’s power efficiency using the FireStrike benchmark and an external consumption monitor. Throughout benchmarking we retest all previous-generation and competing cards to ensure that frame rates are accurate, and that cards have been tested using the latest drivers available.

Best Graphics Card Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti
1. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
Best for performance and ray tracing

Pros:

Capable of 60fps in 4K with most games
Future-proofed with exciting features such as ray tracing and DLSS
Super-overclockable
Keeps cool and quiet all of the time
Cons:

Incredibly expensive
Limited games support ray tracing and DLSS 
Part of Nvidia’s new Turing lineup, the RTX 2080 Ti is the most powerful graphics card that consumers can buy with amped up specs and potentially revolutionary features.

While the GTX 1080 Ti struggles to achieve 60fps in 4K for some of the most technically demanding games, the RTX 2080 Ti hits that golden standard for almost every title you throw its way.

Even more lust-worthy, the RTX 2080 Ti features exciting tech including real-time ray tracing and DLSS. The former helps to simulate more realistic light in video game environments, while the latter uses artificial intelligence to make image rendering slicker and more efficient. Sadly, only a few games currently support these features, including Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus.

The only significant negative thing about the RTX 2080 Ti? It costs a whopping lot. At £1099, it’s almost double the price of the ultra-powerful GTX 1080 Ti. But if you’re desperate for the best 4K performance possible, as well as ray tracing, then the RTX 2080 Ti is still a worthwhile investment.

PNY GTX 1660 Ti

2. PNY GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
Best value for Full HD gaming

Pros:

Fantastic value Full HD performance
Intelligent shading improves efficiency for modern games
Small enough for mini-ITX cases
Cons:

Limited overclocking potential
The GTX 1660 Ti represents fantastic value for money for 1080p gamers. It beats the GTX 1060 for frame rates considerably, and pushes both the GTX 1070 and RTX 2060 hard too. At £260, it’s also cheap.

Aimed squarely at buyers who want a new GPU, but can’t afford, or won’t appreciate the full strength of the ray tracing and DLSS features of Nvidia’s flagship 20 Series cards, the GTX 1660 Ti is only available from a number of third party manufacturers – no Founders Edition version of this card is in the works.

The GTX 1660 Ti version we’ve tested is a XLR8 OC from PNY. Despite its name, there’s not much potential for overclocking here; we were able to get a 130MHz overclock during testing, but not much more than that.

That said, you’ll be able to get a 120fps Full HD performance on the likes of Fortnite, PUBG and Apex Legends, with minimal fuss. For battle royale shooters, you couldn’t ask for a smoother experience.

And even if you’re not fussed about big online brawlers, the GTX 1660 Ti is still the best value 1080p graphics card you can currently buy.

3. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060
Best value for ray tracing

Pros:

Solid 1080p and 1440p performance
Future-proof with Turing
Decent value when compared to the 1070
Cons:

Ray tracing and DLSS still not widely supported
The RTX 2060 is the cheapest 20-Series card available which gives you all the benefits of Turing’s architecture. This means it’s the only semi-affordable way to take advantage of the full compliment of Ray Tracing and DLSS technologies.

This is a big deal as, from what we’ve seen testing Ray Tracing on Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus, the tech is pretty awesome. Ray Tracing improves how games render lighting effects, shadows and reflections, making them look super realistic. It’s also being touted by Nvidia as the future of gaming, which given the number of titles confirmed to support it this year the claim could well be accurate.

Ray Tracing aside, the RTX 2060 offers impressive grunt performance that easily matches the older GTX 1070. This means most triple-A titles will run at 60 fps or above with their graphics settings maxed at 1080p. This makes this GPU the best value RTX graphics card currently available.

GTX 1660
4. Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660
Great Full HD performance at a low, low price

Pros:

Superb value for Full HD gaming
Adaptive shading gives modern games a performance boost
Incredible optimisation for battle royale game
Cons:

The slightly more expensive GTX 1660 Ti offers better value
The Gigabyte GTX 1660 is one of the cheapest mid-range Nvidia-powered graphics cards on the market, offering a superb Full HD performance for just £2o0. Thanks to the new Turing TU116 architecture and new efficient shading methods, the GTX 1660 card offers a big bump on performance compared to its similarly priced Pascal siblings.

Our tests prove the GTX 1660 is capable of running modern AAA games, such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider, at high frame rates, while even being able to achieve a respectable Quad HD performance for titles released a few years ago. Fortnite and Apex Legends fans will certainly benefit, with the GTX 1660 optimised specifically for battle royale games.

The only drawback to the GTX 1660 is that the GTX 1660 Ti offers a noticeably better performance at a slightly more expensive price. We’d recommend going for the latter, but if you’re on a super strict budget, the GTX 1660 will still serve you well.

ROG Strix RTX 2070

5. Asus ROG Strix RTX 2070 O8G Gaming
Stellar Quad HD and ray tracing performance

Pros:

Excellent value Quad HD performance
Ray tracing and DLSS support
Remains cool no matter how hard you push it
Cons:

Very poor overclocking potential
Just shy of a good 4K performance
The Asus ROG Strix RTX 2070 O8G Gaming suffers the middle sibling syndrome. This isn’t the cheapest 20-Series graphics card available, and it’s performance is dwarfed by the more expensive 4K-ready RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

What it does offer, though, is great value for its Quad HD performance. The Strix RTX 2070 can handle all but the most power-draining video games at a super-sturdy 60fps, even after activating ray tracing to revel in Battlefield V’s realistic reflections.

The only caveat with this Asus ROG graphics card is that it can’t muster much from an overclock, leaving the additional fan feeling like a wasted expense. On the bright side, you do get customisable RGB lighting, excellent heat dissipation and an improved boosted clock speed when you plump for ROG’s offering instead of Nvidia’s.

Nvidia RTX 2080

6. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080
A cheaper alternative to the RTX 2080 Ti

Pros:

Offers ray tracing and DLSS for cheaper price than RTX 2080 Ti
Capable of running most games in 4K
A sizeable upgrade from the last-gen GTX 1080
Cons:

Offers the same 4K performance as the cheaper GTX 1080 Ti
Limited game support for ray tracing and DLSS
The middle sibling of Nvidia’s new 20 Series graphics cards, the Nvidia RTX 2080 hits the sweet spot for performance and price.

The RTX 2080 offers a significant frame rates boost compared to its Pascal predecessor, the GTX 1080, most notably for modern games such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Ghost Recon Wildlands. We’re talking enough power here to play these games in 4K. It’s not quite beefy enough to hit the 60fps target for such ultra-intensive games, with only the RTX 2080 Ti boasting the power for such a task, but if you fancy saving a few hundred quid the RTX 2080 is a very good compromise.

The RTX 2080 claims a very similar performance power to the GTX 1080 Ti. The only significant difference between the two cards is the former’s far better and more efficient when it comes to ray tracing and DLSS. These features have limited game support right now, but you’ll at least know this GPU is as future-proofed as they come if you do decide to invest.

Best graphics card - AMD Radeon RX 570

7. AMD Radeon RX 570
Budget Full HD option


Pros:
Excellent Full HD performance
Wide range of designs available
Quiet cooler on this model
Cons:

Blurred lines between RX 580 and GTX 1060 pricing
Power hog when overclocked
The RX 570 is a minor improvement to the RX 470 we reviewed in 2016. It has slightly higher clock speeds and lower power consumption when not in use. It’s largely identical to its predecessor, however, so anyone running a 470 needn’t worry.

In terms of performance, expect to run the latest games in Full HD at High and Very High settings. We saw 90+fps in the likes of Battlefield 1 at High settings in Full HD.

It’s now on a level with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 in some benchmarks, and with 4GB and 8GB models available, as well as loads of different cooler designs, if you can grab one for under £190, you’ll be getting a decent deal. But if you can spend a little more, consider an RX 580 instead, as the two are priced very closely.

Best graphics card - AMD Radeon RX 580

8. AMD Radeon RX 580
Budget Quad HD option

Pros:

Brilliant Full HD performance
Decent 1440p performance
Cheapest cards are great value
Cons:

Power hog
No compact cards
A minor update to the RX 480, the RX 580 is the new graphics card of choice for those with a budget of between £190 and £220. It will play the latest games at maximum settings in Full HD, and you can drop to High if you fancy some 1440p action. It’s very similar to the RX 480, and is based on the same GPU. So don’t eliminate AMD’s 400-series GPUs from your shortlist.

There’s a variety of third-party GPU options available, with various levels of overclocking and lots of different cooler designs. It’s a bit of a power hog, however, and you’ll seldom find a compact version of the RX 580. It’s here, where the more efficient GTX 1060 rules the roost as the best graphics card for the money with near-identical performance. Nvidia’s mid-range offering is better for that Mini-ITX build you’ve always wanted to do.

Read our full AMD Radeon RX 580 review
Those are our top picks of the best graphics cards. If you want to know more about about the different types of graphics cards and what to look out for when buying one then read on.

Third-party cards
Whenever you buy a GPU, consider which manufacturer you want to opt for since the  the specs will differ accordingly. Nvidia’s latest 10-series cards also include so-called ‘Founders Edition’ designs, which are the models we review. Third-party models tend to be more expensive and perform slightly better. Common brand names include EVGA, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, XFX, Zotac and many more.

With prices constantly shifting and special offers appearing daily, recommending a specific model purely on its price is difficult. As such, this guide will offer each card’s usual price range and the sort of performance you can expect.

Related: Best gaming monitors

Manufacturer’s cooler designs will also affect performance, but only by single-digit percentage points – this is especially true of cheaper cards. With more expensive GPUs card manufacturers push the boat out, throwing clever fans and software into the mix and offering up higher clock speeds, which can make a difference.

Things to look out for on each card include (in order of importance):

Length of warranty
Price
Overclocking
Fan noise
Visual flare
Extra cooling fans
There’s one more thing to consider, and something we’ll discuss in the later entries in this roundup: AMD Radeon VII . AMD’s top-spec cards have arrived very late to the scene, and look to undercut the Nvidia competition in terms of pricing, while still offering 1440p and 4K gaming performance. The jury is still out on whether these will meet expectations. We wouldn’t hold off buying a different GPU unless there’s something about AMD’s other technologies (such as FreeSync) that gets your juices flowing.

In our series of Best Video Card guides, here’s the latest update to our list of recommended graphics cards for gaming PCs. All numbers in the text are updated to reflect pricing at the time of writing (Mar 6th).

Best Video Cards for Gaming: Q1 2019
For gaming PCs that push the pretty pixels on the screens, the video card is the most important component. And given the sheer amount of custom options, choosing the right graphics card for your budget can be very difficult. In our Video Cards for Gaming guides, we give you our recommendations in terms of GPU models and current prices representative of an affordable non-blower custom card. Our guide targets common gaming resolutions at system-build price points similar to our CPU guides.

Given the increased video card prices that have come to characterize much of 2017 and 2018, 2019 is already off to a better start, especially as more new products have filtered in.

The majority of our recommendations aim to hit the performance/price curve just right, while considering power consumption and graphics/monitor ecosystems.

The Fate of the $300 Value Enthusiast Video Card
For most video card buyers, the key consideration is a card’s performance-per-dollar and their relative budget. It’s an obvious point to bring up, but at the time of the last buyer’s guide, NVIDIA’s three new cards – the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, and RTX 2070 – had more impact due to displacing older high-end GeForce GTX offerings rather than offering strong performance/price gains. So for people looking to spend less than $500 on a graphics card, the 2018 holiday season didn’t change much from mid-year.

This time around, the situation is quite different. Not only has cryptocurrency mining demand died down, but NVIDIA has also continued their top-to-bottom rollout of Turing GeForce cards, which are finally approaching the mainstream segment with the RTX 2060 and GTX 1660 Ti. In turn, Pascal-based GeForce cards are well on their way out from the GTX 1060 6GB and above. Where NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 20 series brought larger price premiums along with their marquee features of hardware-accelerated raytracing and AI operations, the GTX 1660 Ti excludes those aspects to provide comparatively better performance-per-dollar. And as for AMD, with the Radeon RX 590 launch just behind them, the release of the Radeon VII puts an alternative to the RTX 2080.



That being said, it’s not quite a return to the glory days of the Radeon R9 390 and GeForce GTX 970. In the past few generations, that $300 mark was more-or-less a ‘Sweet Spot’ for enthusiast value, offering affordable last-gen flagship performance. Even still, this space is still a good price/performance match for a variable refresh monitor or higher-end VR headset, especially as VR headset and FreeSync/G-Sync monitors are becoming more affordable. The variable refresh technologies themselves can provide smoother gaming experiences, enabling mid-range cards to punch above their traditional weight. But the big development here is NVIDIA’s adoption of VESA Adaptive Sync under the ‘G-Sync Compatible’ branding, meaning that GeForce hardware can now utilize variable refresh rate technology on FreeSync monitors.

Previously, AMD cards were limited to FreeSync/Adaptive Sync and NVIDIA cards were limited to G-Sync, such that your choice of video card locked your options. Between them, NVIDIA charges a premium for G-Sync, which is reflected in higher monitor prices. But because AMD does not have a strict certification program outside of FreeSync 2, there are some questionable FreeSync monitors, and annoyingly, some without support for Low Framerate Compensation (LFC). If you are looking to purchase a FreeSync monitor, LFC is almost mandatory as it maintains the variable refresh experience when the refresh rate dips below the monitor’s minimum, which for many monitors is still 40Hz+. Both technologies, however, have premium versions that offer additional features like HDR: G-Sync Ultimate (formerly G-Sync HDR) and FreeSync 2 HDR.



The question becomes much more difficult, not just with HDR being pushed as the premium gaming experience, but also with NVIDIA's promised raytracing graphical effects and AI-based graphics accelerating features such as Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). Returning to you, the consumer, this means that min-maxing for a VR build or new monitor has become that much harder. Particularly if your game tastes veer towards either DX11 or DX12/Vulkan games; as a rough rule of thumb, GeForce cards tend to perform better on DX11 games while Radeon cards tend to perform better (or at least punch above their weight) on DX12/Vulkan. We will keep these complications in mind when we list our recommendations.

The $2500+ 4K Gaming PC:
If Price Is Little Object - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti ($1300)
With the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 series – and specifically the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and RTX 2080 –4K gaming has finally gotten a true successor to the Pascal-powered GTX 1080 Ti, which has all but vanished. So when it comes to playing at 4K with all the settings cranked up, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the new flagship. Despite the generally higher RTX pricing structure and modest generational gains in traditional performance, the RTX 2080 Ti is essentially the only option for the mortals among us. While the $2500 Titan RTX could make a claim the single GPU crown for no-compromises 4K gaming, the asking price is a little under double for what is comparable performance.

And what you get is 60 fps and beyond at 4K with ultra/max settings in AAA games, and in turn enabling excellent 1440p performance, a natural pairing with high refresh rate monitors (96Hz and above). While on average this is not unlike what we've seen from the Titan V, at $3000 and a peripheral focus on gaming, that prosumer card could only be recommended as a gaming video card where price was truly no object. As opposed to the reference-only Titan V (and Titan RTX), the RTX 2080 Ti also comes in the variety of overbuilt custom cards typical of the highest-end GeForce offering. The RTX 2080 Ti does keep the same size of VRAM with 11 GB but VRAM creep hasn't quite reached 8 GB yet for the vast majority of games.

Reference-to-reference, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti puts up a 32% speedup over the GeForce RTX 1080 Ti, but with custom cards on offer mostly around $1300, greater than the $1200 RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition price point, it's a not insignificant regression in perf-per-dollar for traditional gaming. Nevertheless, this might be acceptable to those wanting the fastest overkill custom card at the tier above the GTX 1080 Ti/RTX 2080, particularly if looking to play games with HDR or future raytracing, AI, or other RTX platform features. But ultimately, it's hard to make a blanket recommendation for the RTX 2080 Ti because of the $1300 cost compared to the $1000 MSRP, despite being around 6 months after the launch.

The $1800 4K/1440p Gaming PC:
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 ($760)
Dropping down from the fastest flagships brings us to familiar ground. At around the $760 price point, the GeForce RTX 2080 slots into where the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti used to be. Which admittedly isn’t moving the needle much on performance – reference-to-reference, the RTX 2080 does outperform the GTX 1080 Ti slightly by 8% – but it does end up bringing more features for the same-ish price. More importantly, now that last gen Pascal stock has petered out, this range doesn’t have many alternatives, so this is the best of what you can get now for this price.

Of course, performance-wise this means that the GeForce RTX 2080 is perfectly suitable for 4K gaming with minimal fuss, though certain AAA titles might see framerates in the 45 – 60fps range. Alternatively, gamers could see this as a better match for high refresh rate gaming on 1440p, perhaps enabling HDR as well. Given the premium costs of G-Sync Ultimate monitors that support 4K, HDR, and 144Hz (among other things), this would be an ideal match for those looking to utilize those features without completely blowing their budget – given that RTX 2080 Ti’s currently go for $1300, while 100+ fps is possible on the less-demanding HDR games.

Reference-to-reference, it's around 35% faster than the GTX 1080, but right now custom card prices are closer to the Founders Edition price of $800 as opposed to the $700 MSRP. In turn, despite the regression in performance-per-dollar in conventional gaming compared to the GTX 1080, the RTX 2080 includes RTX technology support with hardware acceleration of real-time raytracing and AI effects. For early adopters not willing to put more than a grand, this could be a good option.

Runner Up: AMD Radeon VII ($800)

What is new in the high-end is the surprising entrance of AMD’s Radeon VII, introducing 7nm to the gaming GPU space. Released last month, the Radeon VII is AMD's return to the high-end, squaring up with the RTX 2080. Bringing solid no-compromises 4K performance, the card puts up a 32% lead over the Radeon RX Vega 64, slotting in as the new Radeon flagship video card.

Similar to NVIDIA's Founders Edition models, AMD's Radeon VII can also be purchased direct from AMD for a set SEP - in this case, $699. But generally speaking, inventory appears low and prices fluctuating, as is typical for high-end cards early in the release window. At $800, it's hard to recommend the Radeon VII over the GeForce RTX 2080 for gaming; reference-to-reference, it's around 5-6% slower but at higher power consumption. If found at $700, gamers may consider it more of a legitimate alternative against RTX 2080's at the $750+ mark.

Naturally for FreeSync users, the Radeon VII is the new fastest Radeon card around, but unlike 6 months ago, GeForce cards can now take advantage of the Adaptive Sync feature. So here, the FreeSync pairing advantage is limited to users with FreeSync 2 HDR monitors.

The $1500 1440p Gaming PC:
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 ($500)
Announced alongside the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and 2080, the GeForce RTX 2070 succeeds the older GeForce GTX 1070, though not at the same price point. In contrast to its older siblings, GeForce RTX 2070 prices have indeed floated down to its MSRP of $500, giving it the upper hand in terms of performance-per-dollar in this segment. While not the standard 'value enthusiast' $300 offering like the GTX 970, it offers GTX 1080 like performance for conventional gaming, at a GTX 1080 like price. With GTX 1080 inventory all but gone, the RTX 2070 is now the natural replacement.



Buy GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2070 WINDFORCE on Amazon.com
Buy EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC Gaming on Amazon.com
Performance-wise, the GeForce RTX 2070 is capable of pushing around 60fps or more on 1440p on high or maximum settings for the most demanding games. In turn, performance will be sufficient for high refresh rate gaming on 1080p and less demanding 1440p titles. By adjusting graphics settings, the RTX 2070 can also handle 4K, particularly with a G-Sync monitor, as it may not be optimal for single-card 4K on the latest AAA titles.

All told, this card outperforms the reference GTX 1080 it replaces by 10%. So the price and performance calculus is very similar to the RTX 2080 cards; NVIDIA doesn't face strong competition here, so the performance and overall value proposition is unmatched. However that doesn't mean NVIDIA's pricing is very aggressive here. In practice the GTX 1080 has been replaced by a slightly faster and more feature-capable card for around the same price.

Runner Up: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 ($350)

The newest member of the GeForce RTX 20 series family, the GeForce RTX 2060 finally brings a more typical 'value enthusiast' oriented video card for this generation. Without separate Founders Edition pricing, the $350 MSRP is common to all models, and is more-or-less where RTX 2060s can be found today. And with GTX 1070 and above cards well on their way out, the GeForce RTX 2060 stands alone in this price range.

Comparing to its Pascal predecessors, the GeForce RTX 2060 performs at the level of the late-generation refresh GTX 1070 Ti, give or take a few percentage points. At the same time, it still supports the full suite of RTX technology features. So in terms of conventional gaming, the RTX 2060 generally puts up 60fps or more at 1440p, and would be a good fit for high-framerate 1080p gaming. At 6GB of framebuffer though, the RTX 2060 has regressed in VRAM capacity at this price point, compared to the previous $379 8GB GTX 1070. While it's not a concern right now, it could be limiting in a year or two.

As for AMD, the Radeon Vega 64 is the closest thing they offer to an RTX 2070 competitor. In practice it's going to trail the 2070 by around 10% or so in performance, but currently the card is found at the same $500 price as the RTX 2070. The RTX 2060, in turn, offers 95% or so of the Vega 64's performance, but at a substantially lower price and with better power efficiency.

The $1000 1080p+ Gaming PC:
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti ($280)
In an interesting bit of segmentation, NVIDIA's latest release is the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, introducing the carefully named GeForce GTX 16 series. Still based on the Turing architecture powering the GeForce RTX 20 series, the GTX 16 series does lack certain Turing features, namely tensor cores and RT cores. In turn, it does not support the real-time raytracing and AI features of the RTX platform, though it still supports Turing's enhanced shader technology.

Overall, the GTX 16 series purpose is to provide better performance-per-dollar, and at $280 the GTX 1660 Ti does offer the best price/performance to the other Turing GeForce cards. Directly succeeding the $250 GTX 1060 6GB (1280 core), the GTX 1660 Ti comes in as 36% faster and nevertheless occupies an important slot in the 'value enthusiast' area around $300. Very much akin to the GTX 1070 in terms of performance, the GTX 1660 Ti stands as a great match for all-settings-maxed 1080p gaming or generally smooth 45 - 60fps 1440p gaming.

Buy MSI Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 Ti on Amazon.com
If anything, gamers might mull over paying $279 for a xx60 class card, which performs like a $379 card from two years ago. In this respect the GTX 1660 Ti is a much better value proposition than the RTX 2060 above it, but it’s also more expensive than the GTX 1060 6GB it replaces, so it runs the risk of drifting out of the mainstream market entirely. Thankfully pricing here is a lot more grounded than the RTX 20 series cards, but the mainstream market is admittedly more price sensitive to begin with.

Runner Up: AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 ($300)

The release of the GTX 1660 Ti put the screws to the Radeon RX 590, the late-generation Polaris refresh launched last November at $280; head-to-head, the GTX 1660 Ti is faster by about 25% but at significantly less power consumption. For now, RX 590s are still hovering around $280, and so are presently out of frame.



Buy ASUS AREZ Strix Radeon RX Vega 56 on Newegg
For the Radeon RX Vega 56, however, there were early indications of potentially lowering prices to compete with the GTX 1660 Ti. While an official price cut hasn't been announced, the current prices around the $300 mark can make it a more legitimate alternative. Reference-to-reference, the RX Vega 56 is still around 5% faster on average. So if you can overlook the card's high power consumption – the Vega 56 is well off of NVIDIA's power efficiency here – then there's a somewhat faster and proportionally more expensive (around 7%) option in this price range. Otherwise, the reference RX Vega 56 would work fine to match a FreeSync monitor for high quality 1440p and dialed-down 4K gaming.

The $800 1080p Gaming PC:
AMD Radeon RX 570 4GB ($150)
After all the cryptocurrency mania of the past couple years, MSRP took its time returning to some of the hardest-hit models. Among them is the AMD Radeon RX 570, which is presently found at around $150. At that price point, it's priced better than the lesser performing GTX 1050 Ti, and also brings better value compared to the GTX 1060 models that are being phased out.



At launch, we found that the RX 570 performs about 7% over the RX 470 thanks to core and memory clockspeed increases, translating into strong 1080p and playable 1440p performance. For $150, the RX 570 brings a strong value proposition that isn't matched by either the $200 1152 core GTX 1060 3GB slowly on its way out, or the lower-performing GTX 1050 Ti currently around $180.

Buy ASUS RX 570 STRIX OC on Amazon.com
Runner Up: AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB ($200)

For $50 more, the RX 580 8GB comes into play. While the AMD Radeon RX 580 lagged behind the GTX 1060 6GB (1280 cores) by around 7% at 1080p and 1440p at launch, nowadays RX 580 performance is more-or-less on par or better in most scenarios, though certain games will give the 1280 core GTX 1060 6GB the edge.



The RX 580 does have higher power consumption, but the phasing-out of the GTX 1060 6GB has left it priced anywhere from $50 to $100 higher. For $200, the RX 580 8GB also provides an ample amount of VRAM for the foreseeable 1080p future.

What's Next for Video Cards in 2019?
After NVIDIA's GTX 16 series unveiling last month with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti launch, the mainstream market is in for some big changes, and arguably overdue for it. At $280, the GTX 1660 Ti isn't quite a mainstream offering itself, but the expected non-Ti GTX 1660 and lower models should be targeting that range. NVIDIA has taken the top-to-bottom route quite closely for Turing, again pushing the price brackets higher where the mainstream hasn't seen anything even after five cards in. Given the rapid cadence of GTX 16 and RTX 20 series launches, the next couple months might turn out to be quite busy, given that those lower-tier products are necessary for high volume.

On the other side of the aisle, AMD's new high-end release, the Radeon VII, hasn't dramatically changed the competitive landscape, though it does offer more options for consumers in that enthusiast market. More pressing is a competitive response to NVIDIA's newest mid-range-ish and lower offerings. While AMD's upcoming Navi architecture is due sometime later this year, details are of course scarce; in the meantime, the older first generation Vega and Polaris will need repositioning to hold the fort. For now, the reaction has been a lot on the game bundles side, which both AMD and NVIDIA are presently utilizing.

Just upgraded one of my rigs with the GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5X dual fan from Newegg last week for $199. It’s $209 now with some free stuff. Some of the 1060s 6GB are up to $280, such as EVGA. At $199, I think this card is the best bang for the bucks. I only tried a couple games so far (SoulCalibur 6, Skyrim) and some tender test. Max temp 41C, ambience 28C, fan speed always at minimum 33%. SC6 at maximum settings with 100% scaling on 1080p and it only uses ~70% GPU at constant 60fps. I forgot specific settings on Skyrim (this freaking game induces nausea and give me headache every time I play it).

I was gonna repaste it with MX4 and OC it, especially the GDDR5X potential but didn’t need to. This card is awesome. IMO it’s at $200 sweet spot. I will try BF5 and Nier next.

We’re (finally) entering a quiet stretch for new graphics hardware. Radeon graphics cards based on a new “Navi” architecture are expected to launch sometime in 2019, but AMD hasn’t publicly stated any sort of release window for the GPUs.
Best budget graphics card
 

Gigabyte Aorus Radeon RX 570
 
Read PCWorld's review
$159.99See Iton Newegg
The Gigabyte Aorus is a gorgeous, well-performing graphics card. The Radeon RX 570 is the best sub-$200 gaming option around—but it isn't much of a step up over the RX 470.

The best low-cost graphics card you can buy right now didn’t start off as one. The AMD Radeon RX 570 started off as a $180 refresh of the already-great Radeon RX 470, but now that 2018’s cryptocurrency crunch is over and Nvidia’s new wave of mainstream GPUs is starting to crest, this family of graphics cards is starting to get cheap. Like, really cheap. “You can always find a Radeon RX 570 for $130 with two free games thrown in” cheap.

That’s an incredibly enticing price for a superb 1080p graphics card that can hit the hallowed 60 frames per second mark at High or Ultra settings in most modern games. You may need to tinker with some visual settings to achieve that goal, though. Both 4GB and 8GB versions are available. Always take more memory if you can afford it in a graphics card, but the cheaper 4GB models should hold up fine at 1080p resolution in most games.

The insane value proposition of these discounted Radeon RX 570 graphics cards have rendered true budget GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1650, the older GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and the Radeon RX 560 obsolete unless you need a graphics card that doesn’t require any extra power connections. Just get one of these—and enjoy those free games while you’re at it.

Best 1080p graphics card
 

EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 XC Ultra
 
Read PCWorld's review
$229.99See Iton Amazon
Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1660 and EVGA's superb XC Ultra custom design result in a new mainstream gaming champion. This is the graphics card you want for 1080p gaming at 60 frames per second.

Buckle up: While AMD claims the victory in the budget category, from here on out, the best graphics cards all belong to Nvidia, which recently rolled out both GeForce RTX 20-series and GTX 16-series GPUs.

Many PC gamers play on basic 1080p, 60Hz monitors, thanks to their compelling blend of resolution, speed, and affordable pricing. The best graphics card for feeding those displays is Nvidia’s $220-and-up GeForce GTX 1660, which we crowned “the new ‘sweet spot’ champion” in our review. The GTX 1660 beats the snot out of the Radeon RX 580—our previous long-standing sweet spot recommendation—in performance, soaring well past 60 fps in the games in our testing suite. It’s even faster than the Radeon RX 590, a card that costs $40 more at retail. On top of the performance advantage, the GeForce GTX 1660 comes equipped with 6GB of RAM, runs cool, and is incredibly power-efficient compared to its Radeon rivals. Plus, modern GeForce GPUs now play nice with affordable FreeSync monitors as well as pricier G-Sync display option. The GTX 1660 is a no-brainer.

A GREAT 120HZ/144HZ 1080P GAMING OPTION

EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti XC Ultra
 
Read PCWorld's review
$309.99See Iton Amazon
The EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti XC Ultra strips out fancy extras to focus purely on great performance in all functional areas. It's an outstanding all-around graphics card for 1080p and 1440p gaming.

Well, most of the time. We’ve recently witnessed incredibly good sales for the Radeon RX 580 that bring it down to the $170 or $180 range, with two free triple-A games thrown in. The GeForce GTX 1660 pummels it, but if you can find a deal that juicy, the Radeon RX 580 still delivers an outstanding 1080p gaming experience.

Conversely, if you’re playing on a 1080p monitor with an ultra-fast 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate, consider investing in the more powerful $280 GeForce GTX 1660 Ti instead. It provides significantly more performance legroom than the GTX 1660, and you’ll appreciate it at those higher speeds. The GTX 1660 Ti could double as an entry-level 1440p gaming card, too.

Best 1440p graphics card
 

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition
 
Read PCWorld's review
See Iton Amazon
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Founders Edition delivers superb 1440p and 1080p gaming as well as real-time ray tracing in an affordable package. The design of the graphics card is stunning, too.

Now we’re getting into the futuristic stuff—the GeForce RTX 20-series graphics cards, rife with hardware dedicated to real-time ray tracing and AI enhancements. But beyond those bleeding-edge extras, Nvidia’s RTX GPUs can just plain game.

The GeForce GTX 1660 and 1660 Ti are fine options for a decent 1440p/High gaming experience, but you won’t be able to crank graphics options to the max and still hit 60 fps in many games. That’s where the $350 GeForce RTX 2060 comes into play. This card delivers outstanding frame rates at 1440p even with all the bells and whistles turned on. It can feed the needs of a high-refresh-rate 1080p display, too.

$359.99See Iton Amazon
The GeForce RTX 2060 is about 10 to 20 percent faster than the previous-gen GTX 1070, our last 1440p gaming champion. While it can’t quite topple the GTX 1080 or Radeon Vega 64 in raw performance, it costs a lot less than those options while running much cooler, quieter, and more efficiently. It trades blows with AMD’s Radeon Vega 56, but that card costs more while lagging behind the RTX 2060 in those crucial quality-of-life considerations.

Here’s where Nvidia’s bet on the future of gaming takes shape. The cutting-edge Turing GPU inside the 2060 and its pricier RTX siblings enable real-time ray tracing and AI-enhanced image processing, thanks to hardware dedicated to those tasks. The first wave of RTX-enabled games have been slow to appear, but they’re finally picking up steam, with Battlefield V, Final Fantasy XV, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Anthem, and Metro Exodus—which offers the best RTX implementation so far—flying the flag for Nvidia’s new tech.

Best graphics card 2019: Top GPUs for 1080p, 1440p and 4K
Playing your cards right

Katharine Castle

Hardware Editor

7th May 2019 / 10:45AM

Featured post
With new graphics cards coming out left, right and centre these past few months, our best graphics card list has seen a heck of a lot of new entries lately. We’ve had several new entries from Nvidia and AMD alike, and our best GPUs for gaming at 1080p, 1440p and 4K have all been completely refreshed as a result.

There are more to come, too, in the form of AMD’s Navi cards. These probably won’t arrive until later in the summer, but it’s likely we’ll see even more new bestest best graphics cards make it into this list in the not too distant future. There are still plenty of great graphics cards to get stuck into at the moment, though, and the GPUs I’ve gathered together below are, I think, the best graphics cards you can buy right now. Whatever your budget, we’ve got a best graphics card recommendation for you, whether it’s for playing games at 1920×1080, 2560×1440 or 4K.

Best graphics card 2019 guide
Here are the rules. For each resolution, you’ll find two best graphics card recommendations: the best graphics card for playing games at 60fps on max settings at said resolution, plus the card you should actually buy if you’d rather save a bit of money and aren’t that fussed about having the bestest best graphics. This way, our best graphics card list caters for both the budget conscious among you, and those who’d rather spend a little extra to max out their current monitor setup.

As for which particular brand of graphics card you should buy, a lot of that will come down to personal choice. More expensive cards tend to have superior cooling and faster factory overclock speeds, but in terms of performance increase, you’re probably only looking at a couple of frames per second difference – as my RTX 2080Ti benchmark showdown shows. My advice is to simply go for the cheapest one you can find, as I’m not overly convinced you’re really getting that much more for your money by opting for something more expensive.

It’s also important to think about the size of your case. If you’re building a mini-ITX PC, for instance, then you’ll want to look for ‘mini’ versions of your chosen graphics card. These often have a single fan and are slightly less powerful than their full-sized siblings, but they’re a great alternative for smaller PC cases, or those looking to save a bit of money.



Best graphics card for 1080p: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
What you should actually buy: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 580 (8GB)
Prices:
GTX 1660 Ti – From £260 / $280
GTX 1660 (6GB) – From £200 / $220
RX 580 (8GB) – From £168 / $170
If you want to play games at maximum settings at 1920×1080, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is definitely the way to go. Able to offer a smooth 60fps in pretty much every one of today’s biggest blockbusters on Ultra graphics quality (and even faster frame rates on High if you have a high refresh rate monitor), this card is fantastic value for money.

However, as we’ve seen in my GTX 1660 vs GTX 1660 Ti comparison piece, those looking to keep costs down closer to £200 / $200 will almost certainly do just as well with the non-Ti version of the card, the regular GTX 1660. After all, you’re still able to play games at 60fps on High most of the time, and still get a decent Ultra experience, even if it isn’t quite as nippy as the GTX 1660 Ti. The GTX 1660 is also a much better investment than my previous best graphics card for 1080p recommendation, the 6GB version of the GTX 1060, as it offers superior speeds for the same amount of money – just check my GTX 1660 vs GTX 1060 article to see what I mean.

If you want to keep costs down even further, though, the 8GB AMD Radeon RX 580 is arguably even better value for money. The RX 580 not quite as fast as the GTX 1660, but it’s still able to offer 60fps on High to max settings in most of today’s big games at 1080p, and you currently get two free games (The Division 2 and World War Z) with it, too.

In my eyes, the RX 580 is a much better buy than either of the next two cards down as well, the even cheaper Nvidia GTX 1650 or the 8GB version of AMD’s RX 570. As you can see in my GTX 1650 vs RX 570 article, the RX 570 is the clear winner out of these two identically priced GPUs, but that in turn isn’t actually that much cheaper than the RX 580, so you might as well spend the little bit extra and get a superior card in the process.

Best graphics card for 1440p: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060
What you should actually buy: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
Prices:
RTX 2060 – From £329 / $349
GTX 1660 Ti – From £260 / $280
Nvidia’s new RTX 2060 is an absolutely stonking 1440p GPU. Previously, you would have had to have forked out another £100 / $100 for something like Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070Ti or AMD’s Radeon RX Vega 56 to get proper 60fps perfection on maximum or high quality settings at this resolution, but now the RTX 2060 can do everything they can and more for a heck of a lot less. Plus, it can make use of all the new Nvidia RTX features such as its reflection-enhancing ray-tracing tech and performance-boosting DLSS.

If you’re looking for something a little bit cheaper (and really aren’t fussed about ray tracing or DLSS), then you should get Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti instead. As you can see from our GTX 1660 Ti vs RTX 2060 comparison article, the GTX 1660 Ti isn’t actually that far behind the RTX 2060 in a lot of cases, making it an equally good choice for those after a highly capable 1440p card.

There’s also a case to be made for AMD’s Radeon RX 590 as well if you’re not that fussed about having the best-looking polygons at this resolution and want a free copy of The Division 2 or World War Z, but with prices starting at £235 / $240, I’d argue the GTX 1660 Ti is still the superior GPU.

Best graphics card for 4K: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti
What you should actually buy: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon Vega 64
Prices:
Vega 64 – From £399 / $515
RTX 2070 – From £460 / $500
RTX 2080Ti – From £1000 / $1200
It’s ludicrously expensive, but if you’ve got the cash and are after the best of the best that 4K has to offer, then the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti is the only card around right now that can do a silky smooth 60fps at 4K on max settings without compromise. You’ll also benefit from all of Nvidia’s best RTX features as and when developers eventually patch in support for all the confirmed ray tracing and DLSS games, and you probably won’t have to upgrade your graphics card again for a considerable number of years.

The thing is, you can still get a pretty damn good 4K experience for almost half as much money. With the GTX 1080 becomingly increasingly scarce, Nvidia’s RTX 2070 is now a much better proposition for would-be 4K-ers. The RTX 2070 is a smidge faster than the GTX 1080, plus it does all the neat RTX bits and bobs that the RTX 2080Ti can do. You won’t be playing on max settings unfortunately, but if you’re fine with somewhere between 45-50fps (or indeed 60fps in some cases) on either Medium or High, then the RTX 2070 is much better value for money than its ludicrously expensive sibling.

If that doesn’t sound quite good enough for you, then you can always opt for either the RTX 2080 or Radeon 7. Both of these offer much smoother frame rates on High at 4K, but they’re also a lot more expensive – around £650 / $700 at time of writing, with the RTX 2080 just edging out the Radeon 7 in terms of overall value – see our Radeon 7 vs RTX 2080 comparison piece for more info.

The main reason why I haven’t recommended either of these cards as the 4K cards to buy here, however, is because I’ve found they both seem to bottleneck when paired with my Core i5 CPU, which hinders their overall performance. The RTX 2070, on the other hand, doesn’t appear to suffer from such problems, and neither does my other recommendation in this category, the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64. As a result, I’d only recommend splashing out on the RTX 2080 or Radeon 7 if you have a Core i7 or Ryzen 7 CPU at your disposal, otherwise you’ll be doing yourself a disservice.

Indeed, the Vega 64 is a particularly enticing prospect at the moment, as prices have just been getting better and better. It’s not quite as powerful as the RTX 2070, truth be told, but its cheaper price (at least in the UK) plus the same two free games deal mentioned above all add up to make it another tempting offer for those looking to keep costs down.

Is now a good time to buy a new graphics card?
Probably. At time of writing, there are no more big confirmed graphics card launches or release dates that we currently know about at the moment, other than AMD’s Navi cards, which will likely arrive sometime over the summer. It’s possible we may still see a Ti variant of Nvidia’s GTX 1650 come out as well, but for the next couple of months at least, it’s all looking pretty quiet.

It’s also too early to say exactly what AMD’s Navi cards are going to be like, too. They could be another bunch of high-end cards like their recently released Radeon 7, or they could be an entire suite of budget to mid-range cards. We just don’t know.

As a result, it’s probably worth hanging on a bit to see what’s going to happen. However, if you’re a die hard Nvidia fan who wouldn’t ever consider getting an AMD graphics card, then I reckon you’re pretty safe to upgrade. Apart from the aforementioned Ti variant of the GTX 1650 potentially being a thing in the not too distant future, there are plenty of new graphics cards to choose from right now, and I think you should be pretty happy with what’s on offer.

How we test:
Whenever a new graphics card comes in for testing, I put it through a number of gaming tests using both in-game benchmarking tools and real-world gameplay, where the aid of frame rate counters help me determine what kind of average frame rate you can expect at various different quality settings. Currently, I test each graphics card with the following games:

Shadow of the Tomb Raider
Total War: Warhammer II
The Witcher III
Doom
Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
Forza Horizon 4
Monster Hunter: World
Final Fantasy XV
Metro Exodus
In each case, I see what’s possible at the highest graphics setting at 1920×1080, 2560×1440 and, if it can handle it, 3840×2160 (4K). Then I aim to get each game running at 60fps at each resolution, giving you the best case scenario for each one and an idea of what kind of compromises you’ll have to make.

If you’re also looking for a new monitor to go with your new graphics card, make sure you check out our best gaming monitor recommendations as well.

BEST GRAPHICS CARDS 2019: TOP GPUS FOR EVERY BUDGET
Share. To RTX or not, that is the question.

The GPU market is in a pretty interesting place right now. After what felt like eternity, Nvidia introduced both its premium RTX GPUs and some of its most affordable GTX graphics cards yet. Meanwhile, AMD introduced its Radeon VII, shaking things up a bit by giving gamers an 7nm GPU alternative to Nvidia's fully-fleshed out Turing line-up.

So, what's the best graphics card right now? That answer depends on your needs and budget. It takes a lot of research, time, and knowledge to pick out the best graphics card out of the dozens of models and hundreds of variants of said GPUs, however, that's exactly why I put together this guide to the best graphics cards on the market for you

TL;DR – These are the Best Graphics Cards:

Asus ROG Strix GeForce GTX 1660 Ti OC
Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080Ti OC
Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2060 AMP
Asus TUF Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 OC
AMD Radeon VII
EVGA RTX 2080 8GB FTW3 Ultra
PowerColor Red Dragon Radeon RX 570
XFX RX 590 Fatboy
Nvidia Titan RTX
1. Asus ROG Strix GeForce GTX 1660 Ti OC
The Best Graphics Card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 1,536 ● Base Clock: 1,500MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,890MHz ● Video Memory: 6GB GDDR6 ● Memory Speed: 12Gbps ● Memory Bus: 192-bit ● Power Connectors: 1 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 2 x DisplayPort 1.4, 2 x HDMI 2.0b ● Size: 11.9" x 5.2" x 1.97"
If you ask me, the best graphics card isn’t automatically the most powerful, but rather the one that strikes the right balance of performance to price. Following that logic, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce GTX 1660 Ti OC (read our review) is the best graphics card you can buy.

For a little more than $300 this graphics card churns out silky smooth 1440p gaming in most cases, and even some playable 4K experiences hovering around 30 frames per second (fps). For a card meant to replace the Nvidia GTX 1060, it hits above its weight class, offering performance on par with the GTX 1070 and GTX 1070 Ti—and cuts close to the RTX 2060’s performance.

The Asus ROG Strix GeForce GTX 1660 Ti OC is a top of the line, overclocked version of Nvidia’s mid-range card, so those looking to spend less than $300 for a fast GPU should consider the more affordable EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti XC Gaming or Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Windforce OC 6G instead.

2. Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Ti OC
The Best 4K Graphics Card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 4,352 ● Base Clock: 1,350MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,665MHz ● Video Memory: 11GB GDDR6 ● Memory Speed: 14Gbps ● Memory Bus: 352-bit ● Power Connectors: 2 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 1 x USB-C, 2 x DisplayPort 1.4, 2 x HDMI 2.0b ● Size: 12" x 5.13" x 2.13"
Seriously, the Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Ti OC (read our review) is an amazing graphics card if you want to run the latest games at a full 60 fps, or faster, at 4K and Ultra quality settings. Also, if you want to live in the Nvidia's world of ray-traced graphics, look no further, you won't find another consumer GPU better equipped to give you realistic reflections in Battlefield V.

Out of all the RTX 2080 Ti GPUs I tested, including the Zotac GeForce RTX 2080 Ti AMP (read our review), this card came out on top in terms of performance. The Asus ROG Strix GeForce RTX 2080 Ti OC's overclocking goes a step further than the Zotac and the other 2080 Ti cards, putting it at the top of my list.

While this is the absolutely most powerful consumer GPU you can get, the power increase doesn't march lock-step with its price. You will pay significantly more for a 2080 Ti over a 2080, with only a slight jump in performance. If you absolutely require the best of the best, by all means, but if you don't see the value in it, consider any of the other GPUs on my list.

3. Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2060 AMP
Best 1440p RTX Graphics Card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 1,920 ● Base Clock: 1,365MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,800MHz ● Video Memory: 6GB GDDR6 ● Memory Speed: 14Gbps ● Memory Bus: 192-bit ● Power Connectors: 1 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0 ● Size: 8.3" x 4.7" x 1.61"
Out of the entire Nvidia Turing lineup, the Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2060 AMP (read our review) is arguably the most sensible GeForce RTX card to buy. For just a little more than the price of a GTX 1060 (originally $299), you get a much faster card. And unlike its 10-series predecessor, there's no 3GB model: the 2060 comes with a standard 6GB GDDR6 video memory.

In my testing, I had no problem getting over 30 fps in 4K with everything turned up in games like Monster Hunter World. Games like Battlefield 1 and Far Cry 5 almost hit 60 fps at the same settings. Impressive for a card under the $350 mark. At 1440p, the RTX 2060 also knocks it out of the park, crushing the 60fps mark, and often, surpassing it.

4. Asus TUF Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 OC
Best 1080p Graphics Card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 1,408 ● Base Clock: 1,530MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,845MHz ● Video Memory: 6GB GDDR5 ● Memory Speed: 8Gbps ● Memory Bus: 192-bit ● Power Connectors: 1 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0b, 1 x DVI-D ● Size: 8.1" x 4.8" x 1.8"
The GTX 1660 is the creamy middle of the Nvidia new mid-to-entry level 16-series family. It has the 6GB of video memory and handily beats the performance of last-gen's GTX 1060 GPU. If you don't need to run your games on Ultra at 60fps in 4K, the GTX 1660 can easily run them at 60 fps on 1080p—and 1440p Ultra.

It might not have the magical RTX designation like its bigger brothers, but it costs significantly less than the RTX 2060 while providing much of the same FHD and QHD gaming performance. This is the graphics card PC Gaming beginners should buy.

5. AMD Radeon VII
The Best AMD Graphics Card
Stream Processors: 3,840 ● Base Clock: 1,400MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,800MHz ● Video Memory: 16GB HBM2 ● Memory Speed: 2Gbps ● Memory Bus: 4,096-bit ● Power Connectors: 2 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0b ● Size: 11.02" x 4.92" x 1.57"
The newest GPU from AMD, the Radeon VII (read our review), is also its best GPU yet. The "world's first 7nm gaming GPU" delivers great 4K and stellar 1440p performance, and its list price is unsurprisingly better than a comparable card from Nvidia.

You don't get the fancy ray-tracing promised in the new RTX series cards, but given how few games take advantage of the new technology, it's probably still not worth the trouble yet. In my testing the Radeon VII proves to be a great GPU for both gaming and compute tasks. It’s 16GB of video RAM might look excessive on paper, but it comes in handy in more games than you would think, as multiple modern titles end up using more than 8GB of video memory.

If you're an AMD diehard, or you're just looking for a great way to dive into the world of 4K gaming without paying the Nvidia tax, the Radeon VII is a great choice as both the best AMD card around right now and one of the best graphics card for the money.

6. EVGA RTX 2080 8GB FTW3 Ultra
Best for High-End Gaming for Most Gamers
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 2,944 ● Base Clock: 1,515MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,860MHz ● Video Memory: 8GB GDDR6 ● Memory Speed: 14Gbps ● Memory Bus: 256-bit ● Power Connectors: 2 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 1 x USB-C, 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0b ● Size: 11.89" x 5.48" x 2.75"
The EVGA RTX 2080 8GB FTW3 Ultra has an 1,860MHz boost clock, three big, whisper-quiet fans to keep it running cool, but perhaps most importantly, it has the power of RGB lighting. If you're going to spend a bunch of money on a graphics card to make your gaming PC into a 4K powerhouse, you're going to want to show it off, so why settle for anything less than flashy lighting?

Beyond the flashy presentation, the FTW3 Ultra comes with EVGA's X1 overclocking software, so you can push it beyond its factory limits. And really, isn't that the true heart of PC gaming? To give you an idea of what the EVGA is capable of, you can check out the RTX 2080 Founders Edition (read our review), and then imagine it with RGB lights and overclocking.

7. PowerColor Red Dragon Radeon RX 570
Kick Off Your Esports Career with this Graphics card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
Stream Processors: 2,048 ● Base Clock: 1,168MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,250MHz ● Video Memory: 4GB GDDR5 ● Memory Speed: 7Gbps ● Memory Bus: 256-bit ● Power Connectors: 1 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0b, 1 x DVI-D ● Size: 10.04" x 5.39" x 1.85"
The AMD Radeon RX 570 GPU is a well performing graphics card for 1080p gaming, and its particularly spectacular for eSport gaming. Its low, low price of just $130 makes it spectacular buy for users on a budget. With 4GB of video memory and a 1,250MHz boost clock, it offers all the performance you need to play Overwatch, Dota 2, and Rainbox Six Siege at a competitive level.

Whether you’re using a 1080p 144Hz gaming monitor or 240Hz gaming monitor, this graphics card gives you fantastic Full HD gaming experience without breaking the bank. The RX 570 is a superb choice for eSports fans.

8. Nvidia Titan RTX
The Out of Your Mind Graphics Card
UK readers: See it at Amazon (UK)
CUDA Cores: 4,608 ● Base Clock: 1,350MHz ● Boost Clock: 1,770MHz ● Video Memory: 24GB GDDR6 ● Memory Speed: 14Gbps ● Memory Bus: 384-bit ● Power Connectors: 2 x 8-pin ● Outputs: 1 x USB-C, 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0b ● Size: 10.5" x 4.38" x 1.8"
When you absolutely, positively need the most powerful graphics card money can buy, you should look no farther than the Nvidia Titan RTX. For the kingly price of $2,500, the Titan RTX is fully loaded with an absurd 4,608 CUDA cores, 24GB of GDDR6 video memory, and 1,770 MHz boost clock. With these supreme specs, it offers 4K Ultra gaming at frame rates well above 60 fps that no other single GPU can offer.

But honestly, buying this card just to play games would be a waste, as it's also rendering powerhouse for video editing, 3D rendering, and other creative pursuits. If you have the money and the need for a GPU this powerful, the Nvidia Titan RTX is the graphics card of your dreams.

What to look for in a Graphics Card
Below I explain how to pick the GPU for the display you have, why there are so many variants of the same Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, and a few factors you should consider when buying a GPU.

Above all, you should buy the graphics card you need for the display you’re using. If you’re gaming on a Full HD monitor, it would be a huge waste to buy a graphics card designed to play games at 2160p or 1440p. Likewise, you’ll want a powerful graphics card to drive games playing on that premium 4K gaming monitor or 4K TV.

I’ve laid out what are the best graphics cards to play games at 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p resolutions above, but here are some more general rules. For a decent to high-frame rate Full HD experience, you should look at GPUs ranging from the GTX 1050 Ti to the GTX 1660 Ti on Nvidia’s end. If you’re looking at AMD’s graphics card family, you’ll want a Radeon RX 480 or up.

Jumping up to QHD resolutions will require a more capable graphics card, ideally an Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 580 and up. 4K gaming using a single card is still a tough proposition, but it’s actually within reach of the latest graphics cards like the Nvidia RTX 2080 and AMD Radeon VII.

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, Nvidia, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
Graphics card variants
Ok, you’ve decided which graphics card you want, great! However, even with this monumental decision out of the way, the world of GPUs isn’t done being confusing and daunting just yet.

Although there are only two companies—Nvidia and AMD—that actually manufacture the GPUs, there are dozens of different variants of the same graphics card. For example, when the most recent graphics card launched, the Nvidia GTX 1650, there was a multitude of different versions from Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, EVGA and the list goes on.

In this case, while Nvidia may have introduced only one new GPU model, vendors or board partners will introduce their own versions featuring different overclock settings, cooling systems, and other differentiating factors I will explain below.

Length: One of the number one factors you should consider before plopping down cash for that shiny new graphics card is whether it will actually fit. If you’re building your PC in a Mini ITX case, you should be looking at the smallest or mini graphics cards that will actually fit inside.

Overclocking: Most third-party cards—and even Nvidia’s own Founders Edition cards—will often come factory overclocked, and this means the graphics card has been tuned to operate above its rated maximum clock speed. As you might expect, the higher the number the better the performance.

At this point you won’t find many, including the entry-level cards, without some amount of ‘overclocking from the factory.’ However, even without a factory overclock, it’s easy enough do it yourself using software such as EVGA Precision X or MSI Afterburner.


Cooling solutions: In your quest for the best graphics card, you might have noticed that some models come with one, two, or up to free fans. As you might expect, more fans equals better cooling, but there are also two distinct ways of keeping your graphics card chilled.
GPUs equipped with only one fan use a blower style cooler, which means the card sucks in air and blows it out the back like a leaf blower. Dual and triple fan setups are often used in conjunction with an 'open-air cooling systems,' which are designed move cool air through the open heatsinks and exhaust heat in every direction.

Blower style coolers are typically most useful for PCs built into small cases to help alleviate their restricted airflow. If the system your building is Micro ATX or Mid tower sized, you’d be better off with an open-air cooled graphics card, as there are more mounting points for multiple case fans to do the brunt of cooling and two (or three) fans are always better than one.

RTX vs GTX: With Turing Nvidia didn’t just introduce better, faster graphics cards it also debuted RTX GPUs with hardware designed to support real-time ray tracing, and AI-powered super sampling and anti-aliasing (known as Deep Learning Super Sampling).

So far, Nvidia premium RTX 20-series cards—including the RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, RTX 2070, RTX 2060, and all their mobile counterparts—are the only GPUs to feature these dedicated components.

Thankfully, Nvidia decreed in early April that you don’t need an RTX card with dedicated RT Cores to process real-time ray tracing, so now both its new GTX 16-series and (most) older 10-series cards can run games with ray tracing turned on.

DLSS is still an RTX exclusive since it requires Tensor cores to function, but it’s a niche performance smoothing feature compared to the strikingly realistic reflections and complex shadows effects that ray tracing produces.

Bargain your way to getting a graphics card
Strangely, one of more affordable ways to get yourself the latest graphics card is to buy a prebuilt gaming PC while it’s on sale. Gaming PCs will often see discounts for hundreds of dollars off, so not only are you saving a ton of money, you’re also avoiding potential headaches that can accompany a DIY build—and you also get a warranty. Prebuilt PCs have come a long way, too.

They aren't proprietary machines with randomly soldered-on components. They're mostly as upgradeable as anything you might put together on your own. Another way of enjoying the latest graphics cards is through gaming laptops.

There are plenty of Nvidia RTX 20- and GTX 16-series gaming laptops out there right now. The new GTX gaming laptops have also hit the streets and they’re far more affordable than the RTX laptops introduced during CES 2019.

Best graphics card 2019 (May)
What's the best graphics card? We've benchmarked all the latest AMD and Nvidia graphics cards to help you find out
Best Graphics Card
The best graphics card will make your gaming PC the only device you want to play games on. And we’ve tested all the latest and greatest GPUs to see which one is right for you and your budget. The graphics card is the beating silicon heart of your gaming rig and we’ve benchmarked every AMD and Nvidia graphics card to pass across our test labs. But should you go for a cheap graphics card or go all in for 4K? We can help.

If you want the absolute pinnacle of graphical prowess you could always drop a cool $2,500 on Nvidia’s Titan RTX, but now the RTX 2080 Ti is finally here, serious 4K performance is actually within reach. I mean yes, it is some $1,200, but that’s less than half the price of a Titan RTX. That’s a bargain, right?

But, if you can’t drop four figures on a GPU, what should you buy right now? Older Nvidia graphics cards are starting to creep up in price in the short-term, now that Nvidia’s Turing architecture, and subsequent RTX 2080, RTX 2080 Ti have been released. But the RTX 2070 is finally available, the RTX 2060 is propping the 20-series up and Nvidia has created a whole new range for the mainstream segment with the GTX 1660 Ti.

And what of AMD? Well, the Radeon VII is difficult to recommend and difficult to find in stock for a not utterly ridiculous price, but the RX 580 and RX 570 are fantastic bargains right now. If $200 is you’re limit, AMD is almost the only way to go.

So whether you’re chasing a good, cheap graphics card, a top-end 4K graphics card, or just simply the overall best graphics card, then we’ve got you covered.

THE BEST GRAPHICS CARDS ARE:
Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti
Nvidia GTX 1660
AMD RX 580 8GB
Nvidia RTX 2060
AMD RX 590
Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti

Cons
Cross Only really worthwhile at MSRP

The latest mainstream GPU from Nvidia still uses all the Turing shader features introduced by the 20-series cards, but lacks the real-time ray tracing or AI finery which marked them apart from the rest of the world’s graphics cards. Though, given that there are precious few titles taking advantage of this holy grail of gaming graphics, that’s not a big loss when it’s all about price/performance ratios.

The GTX 1660 Ti just about takes top spot as best graphics card thanks to the fact it’s fast enough to justify the extra cost over the RX 580’s bargain price. Overclocked cards, such as the STRIX GTX 1660 Ti, are too expensive, and too close to the RTX 2060, but at MSRP the GTX 1660 Ti is a winner. It’s going to be interesting to see how things shake out once the slightly cut-down GTX 1660 arrives at closer to the RX 580’s price.

The new 16-series GPUs occupy a very tight area of the graphics card market, with the GTX 1660 Ti looking after the standard mid-range price point, while this GTX 1660 has been specced and priced to take out the AMD Polaris competition.

With greater performance, and a lower cost compared with the RX 590, the GTX 1660 has rendered it obsolete and put enormous pressure on AMD and its partners to keep the ever-dwindling stock of the bargain RX 580s at a low, low price.

Cons
Cross The GTX 1660 is just ahead

The price of the RX 580 is fantastic considering its serious gaming performance, but the GTX 1660 is faster and just about justifies the extra expense. But if you can’t really stretch beyond the $200 mark the RX 580 still won’t disappoint.

The Polaris-based Radeon cards perform better than the old GTX 1060 competition in a handful of DX12 titles and in Doom’s Vulkan build. They have a superior memory setup, too. Not only does the RX 580 have an extra 2GB of VRAM at its disposal, useful for high-res textures and large open-world games, it’s also got that running over a wider, 256-bit, aggregated memory bus. But the latest Turing cards could be the final two nails in Polaris’ coffin.

Cons
Cross Arguably not a mainstream card

If you’re looking for more than the RX 580 can offer, then it’s a question of shifting up to either the two 16-series cards or pushing further to the RTX 2060. Okay, there’s the RX Vega duo, but with the more-recent Turing architecture taking centre stage we reckon your best bet is to throw your dollar down on the cheapest RTX card of the lot if you’re looking to spend around $300.

Utilising an only slightly truncated TU106 GPU, the RTX 2060 easily outpaces the equally CUDA equipped GTX 1070 across our gaming benchmarking suite. So much so, in fact, it matches even the GTX 1070 Ti in regular ol’ rendering. And with enough RT Cores and Tensor Cores to keep ray tracing chugging over, the RTX 2060 is both a graphics card for the present and the future.

Cons
Cross GTX 1660 Ti is the better bet

The GTX 1660 Ti has our pick as the best graphics card, but the RX 590 isn’t all that different to our previous favourite, the RX 580. AMD copy and pasted its 36 CU GPU onto either GlobalFoundries 12nm or Samsung’s 11nm process, resulting in significantly higher clock speeds over its predecessor. It’s not a huge change when it comes to gaming performance, and the GTX 1660 has now rendered it practically obsolete.

One of the best things the RX 590 has done for the market is make the RX 580 just that much more tantalising with its sub-MSRP prices. That’s the most tempting Radeon card around right now, but if you’re looking for a litttle more gaming power, it’s the latest GeForce GPUs.

Tick Future ray tracing and AI goodness

Cons
Cross Old-school Titan-level pricing

The RTX 2080 Ti is the true next-gen graphics card of the Turing GPU generation and, if pure performance was king, it would be an easy pick for the best graphics card. The RTX 2080 only delivers current gaming performance at the same level as the GTX 1080 Ti, but the RTX 2080 Ti goes well beyond it, offering genuine 4K gaming at 60fps in all but the most demanding of PC games.

There’s also the promise of real-time ray tracing… when Microsoft updates its Windows 10 OS with a new version of DirectX 12. Then there’s AI-based super-sampling that will make your games look prettier and run better. As well as all the other goodness AI will bring to gaming in the future via Microsoft’s WinML API, and the new shader techniques Nvidia has created for Turing. Buy it if you want the ultimate in 4K gaming now, and then bask in the knowledge there’s even more to come.

Cross Super-expensive for a 2nd tier GPU

The second-tier 20-series GPU from Nvidia is still a massively expensive card and yet is only delivering a little more performance than the previous generation’s GTX 1080 Ti – the old best graphics card for 4K gaming. But stock of the top Pascal GPU has dwindled to such a point you can’t pick them up for less than the cost of the RTX 2080 Ti… so that idea’s pretty much out.

And there is more to come from the RTX 2080, and we’re confident it will eventually deliver on Nvidia’s fresh fine wine approach. For now, though, with few affordable reference card versions, it’s a tough sell. But as prices for the GTX 1080 Ti go up as stock volume goes down, and the reverse happens to the RTX 2080, it is fast becoming the go-to card compared to the Pascal GPU.

Cross It’s a 3rd tier GPU for $500…

Nvidia’s third-tier Turing GPU is a really impressive graphics card, it’s just a shame that it’s arrived at GTX 1080 pricing rather than at the old GTX 1070 level. But it does outperform the old Pascal cards, and gets mighty close to the 1080 Ti when you throw some serious overclocking its way. But those factory-overclocked cards are hard to recommend given their super-high pricing.

We still don’t know what the real-time ray tracing and AI processing will eventually offer, but the RTX 2070 does seemingly represent the cheapest entry point if you want to get in at the ground floor of the new tech without necessarily having to hope DLSS comes to the rescue.

Cross The RX 580 is only a little bit more

The RX 570 is finally at a non-ridiculous price now that stock has filtered back into the channel. Actually, with the card sitting cheaper than the Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti, it is actually a kind of ridiculous price… in a good way. It essentially makes the GTX 1050 Ti irrelevant and means there’s only one choice for a budget gaming GPU right now.

You are missing out on the higher level of video memory you get with the 8GB version of the RX 580 or the GTX 1060 6GB, but 4GB is absolutely fine if you’re still rocking a 1080p monitor. With its only slightly cut-down Polaris 20 GPU it’s still got the gaming goods, and if you can’t stretch to the price of an RX 580 or GTX 1660 Ti then the second-tier Polaris card won’t disappoint.

The RX 570 makes the 1050 Ti almost irrelevant, unless you don't have a PSU capable of AMD's power demand.

Pros
Tick Great 1080p gaming performance
Tick Doesn’t need a PSU connection

Cons
Cross 4GB VRAM might become restrictive
Cross RX 570 price makes it almost irrelevant

The Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti was a decent little card year or so ago, but the huge price drop of the RX 570 has effectively retired it. The Radeon GPU has a lot more gaming performance baked inside it and when it’s cheaper and faster the 1050 Ti has almost no hope.

Where the GTX 1050 Ti does stand out, however, is in opening up PC gaming to a wider audience. Because its efficient GPU draws all its power from the PCIe bus, without needing an extra connection from the PSU, it can be an instant upgrade for any off-the-shelf office PC. You can turn pretty much any ropey old PC from the last five years or so into a 1080p gaming machine to be proud of. You can’t ask much more than that.

Not everyone is lucky enough to be totally weapons free on budget when it comes to the most important component in a gaming PC: the graphics card. That’s why picking the best graphics card for your needs is so important – if you can’t afford an RTX 2080 Ti you still need to make sure your money is well-placed in hardware that is going to deliver the best performance for your given budget.

What next? These are the best gaming monitors to go with your GPU

While the RTX 2080 Ti is the boss of 4K gaming, the GTX 1660 Ti and RX 580 are fighting it out for the all-important best graphics card price/performance crown. The RX 580 is a the cheaper option, but the latest Turing GPU does have the performance edge, and the GTX 1660 Ti can kind of now do ray tracing. Kind of. Both offer fantastic frame rates even when the settings are cranked up to the max, and you won’t be left high and dry with either Nvidia or AMD in your system.

The entry-level is almost entirely dominated by the red team, however. The RX 570 is now at such a great price that the GTX 1050 Ti looks incredibly tired by comparison. What it does have going for it is the ability to operate without PSU power connections, but the RX 570 hoses it in gaming terms.
